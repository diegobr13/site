Cristiano, who always mixed discretion with a very particular sense of humor, didn´t refuse to answer any question and has clarified some of the recent controversies and rumors about Mises Brazil. The public, that has been shocked by the Institute misleading and the silence ofthe Chiocca´s brothers, now have the chance to elucidate it all. Follow the enlightening conversation in full:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><b>Hi Cristiano. Thank you for having us here.</b></span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><b> </b></span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><b>Mises Brazil has just launched its website at a new domain, where two notes have been published explaining Helio Beltrão´s departure from the Institute and your election as president.</b></span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><b> </b></span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><b>Tell us what happened.</b></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">– <span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">Thank you for this opportunity.</span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> </span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">I will begin with the last point: my l election as president of the institute. This act was a nothing more than a</span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> </span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">formality. The concession of the president title to Helio has never been more than a simple gesture of gratitude for all his financial support for the Institute that I have envisioned and created along with my brothers. The president figure has always been merely honorific, and that is why it was conferred to Helio, as an act of kindness. On a daily basis, for the first five years, Mises Brasil’s face and imprint had always been given by the Chiocca´s brothers and Leandro Roque, website editor and translator. However, as a result of the mess generated by the increasingly disturbed Helio’s interventions, and due to the fact he arrogated to himself an unsuitable role, now the president figure has become relevant, and I am going to put Mises Brazil again back on its natural track.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">– <span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">Never from our end! Instituto Mises Brazil is now at a new domain because of a conflict created by Helio’s Institute. Anyway, on our launch day I sent a message asking Helio to return us our domain and to stop using our logo in their activities. I also asked for the return of the Facebook fanpage, created and administered by my brother Roberto until it successfully reached more than 100.000 likes. We are hoping that these devolutions can undo the public confusion as soon as possible, so Mises Brazil and Helio Beltrão’s Institute can follow their own paths.</span></span></span></span></p>

Mises Brazil gave him a legion of followers and a content aura that he, as Millenium member, would never get. The ideological radicalism and consistency produced by Mises Brazil gave him that. For Helio, and for his social environment, this was very important, and for this reason he allowed us to make our job in Mises Brazil as we wish. He was gaining prestige and I was watching my idea flourishing.</span></span></span></span></p>

In all our events, conferences and seminars Helio always placed himself on the figurative post of president as if it were formal. He never mentioned me as the originator neither mentioned the staff as worth of merit. This, in fact, never bothered me because I really don’t care, but there were his intentions being unveiled, and I was not sagacious enough to realize it. As Mises Brazil was growing and reaching the establishment gates, Helio started revealing that he hadn’t almost any affinity with the ideas advocated there. His Facebook posts were (and still are) abominations, products of his huge intellectual nullity. We were tired of refuting his posts with articles from the very same Institute that he “presided”.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">– <span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">He never was! Theses such as “tax is not always theft”, “fractional reserve is not fraud”, “free market for ethics”, “kondratiev cycles”, “Austrian Fed”, “is legitimate for the state to own property”, “to be against secession per se” are some of the things that he truly believes, but are the opposite to everything that the Mises Institute advocates. Can anyone imagine Lew Rockwell, Mises or Rothbard rooting for something like “kondratiev cycles”? For us it was always very</span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> </span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">shameful to have as a president someone who, beside the fact that he is not a champion of the misesian praxeology, he doesn’t even know the epistemological foundation of the Austrian School either.</span></span></span></span></p>

– This is a myth that must be demolished. To begin with, if he were a successful entrepreneur he would be more like a Hank Rearden, but even that would still be very far from the true. Helio is an heir (and obviously there is nothing wrong with that). Curiously, however, is the fact that he is son and grandson of politicians. By the way, his father was president of the Petrobras and, in his private life, stockholder of a big petrochemical group. Thereby, to place Helio as a leader or model of a libertarian movement is like if 20 years from now Lulinha (Brazilian ex-president Lula son) would sponsor a classical liberal revolution and then become a liberalism icon. Helio belongs to the establishment and everything he does is to be accepted by and to rise into the establishment, never outside or against it. On the contrary, Rothbard and Lew Rockwell are anti-establishment to their very souls, and this is what Mises Brazil is all about. To place a figure from the establishment as a role model to the libertarian environment was a big mistake.</span></span></span></span></p>

Ever since we have been able of keep the institute´s integrity and strict commitment to libertarian principles and misesian Austrian economics. But in the last couple of years we began to feel that Helio was assuming a diverting position. He had some strange reactions to controversial articles and tried to prohibit the topic “Libertarianism”. We felt that he was willing that the institute would only talk about “economics”, and in a way that would not be too confrontational with other Economic Schools, trying to stress out the similarities among them rather than the disparities – something like Professor Peter Boettke does at GMU. That’s why Helio insisted in having him at our last Conference. Helio also began to publicly support a new political party that claims to have Classical Liberal inspiration. Helio started an academic journal with the objective of getting into the academia, which to us is a naïve thing to do, not to mention a waste of money and resources. Helio declared he aims to influence public policies and to be respected by the media and the academia. He wants the press to consult Mises Brazil in the near future when they are seeking for economic advice.</span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> </span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">How preposterous!</span></span></span></span></p>

Like in the US, we had “blue states” and “red states” and the subject of secession came naturally to the hot spot. Then Helio publicly stated that he was not for secession, prohibited Mises Brazil to publish anything about this topic for at least a month, saying that he was worried about how we could be seen by the “allowable opinion”. He was literally being interlineated by the 3×5 card of approved ideas. We didn’t accept that.

We proposed the detachment of the Mises Brazil sponsorship from the Mises Brazil management, in an attempt to get the institute back on track, and limiting Helio to his financial role. We also wanted to prevent Helio from trying to do what was way above his capacity and knowledge. The few ideas that Helio presented in the Mises Brazil beginning were </span></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">solemnly disregarded.

Helio had some sort of breakdown and made a scene making everyone in the room blush and feel sorry for him. Incapable to refute any of the exposed arguments, he started an infamous scandal. Helio is not used to deal with real men neither is he used to be contradicted, what has degenerated him into a pathetic and spoiled figure. He had been used to have a only flatterers and yes men cortege; he didn’t know that with the Chioccas things would be different. We never cared about his millions of dollars. Although we have always treated him respectfully, not only because he was the donor, we have always clashed with him over relevant issues. Over the years, the Chioccas´ opinions have prevailed. Just when it began to disturb Helio’s personal agenda we entered on a confrontation course.</span></span></span></span></p>

He was thirsty for “respectability”, and to advocate radical ideas openly against the establishment was no longer opportune for him. In Helio´s view, with the sinking of the Brazilian Labor Party (PT) and the deterioration of the Brazilian Social-democratic Party (PSDB) will bring about a power vacuum, and he believes that some of this vacuum will be filled by the Brazilian new Party (NOVO) and its allies. He sees himself as a great leader of this movement and doesn’t want a radical Mises Brazil “to salt his game”. That’s why he pushed us out (or rather, he thinks that he did) and surrounded himself with nullities, best embodied in the perfect fraud of Rodrigo Marinho.

– Yes! You see, Helio hasn’t realized that all he has is the CNPJ, a government number, something we always regarded as useless. Mises Brazil is a homemade Institute and never needed or will need a stamp from a public department to exist or function. I had the idea and built up the Project. By the way, a letter from the Mises Institute authorizing translations was sent under my name. My brother Fernando made the crest that is a world success and delighted Lew Rockwell. The Facebook page, with more than 100.000 likes, was created and administered by my brother Roberto. The website model also has always been the one that we believed that would work best for us. Even the Tax Freedom Day is made in a friend of mine´s gas station. Indeed, Mises Brazil needs money to keep the website up and running and Helio’s endeless resources had helped a lot, of course, but now we are going to look for other sponsors to maintain Mises´ Brazil activities.

And I mean freak because the Austrian libertarianism is not a headless movement that multiplies autonomously from a hierarchy. Austro-libertarianism follows a clear intellectual line coming from Mises, followed by Rothbard and today with Hoppe. Its spreading core is the Mises Institute at Auburn, and not the nonsense ideas that come from Helio´s mind.

Another role of the journal is to grant “points” in the very academy for those few Brazilian Austrian professors, by the way they are professors that have other incompatibility with Mises Brazil: they are ultimately hayekians rather than misesians/rothbardians (exception made only to professor Mueller, more influenced by Rothbard and a Mises Institute Associated Scholar). On the other hand, Mises Brazil, as well as the Mises Institute, has always followed the praxeological economic line that comes directly from Mises and Rothbard, essentially divergent from that of Hayek´s, who despised praxeology.

A short historical analysis shows that in the 1980’s they rouse powerfully, but when the 1990’s privatizations came about they disappeared, for their agenda had been completed.

But not everything in that Première was a lie: when the C.O.O. stressed that now they are starting a new Institute, he was being absolutely precise because IHB is a new Institute indeed, totally different from Mises Brazil. Here we will keep the old and good Mises Brazil, at the same pace of Mises Institute and in the austro-libertarian tradition. I have noticed that they are changing the crest, maybe motivated by the request I have made and helping to disipate the confusion they created to the public. Furthermore, this change is emblematic for another reason: to have Rothbard´s face on the crest always have been an annoyance to Helio, for the radicalism in rothbardian ideas doesn’t match with the liberal leader image that Helio wants to sell. A further point that demonstrate very well the distance between Mises Brazil and IHB was the very Première opening: it was presented by an IFL member, and this alone is enough to show the difference.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">– <span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">Helio always had a obsession for IFL/IEE (entrepreneur institutes). His dream was to have an IFL or an IEE, not an Mises Brazil. As a figure from the establishment, Helio always wanted to emulate his pairs and understood how Gerdau (steel king) has done it. In fact, this is usual. Salim Matar (rent car king) reproduced it in Belo Horizonte, but because São Paulo lacked this initiative, Helio used his network to promot IFL there. Heirs and businessmen groups (well established) have always been Helio´s social environment and for whom he desired to show up as an intellectual figure. And businessmen groups are totally different from an intellectual fruition Institute as Mises Brazil. Entrepreneurs are never an intellectual reference. This role must be occupied by unselfish and serious intellectuals, apart from their professional activities, if some. Moreover, again with the Première, another outstanding episode was when Helio interrupted Rodrigo Marinho presentation, Rodrigo said: “might is right, and obey whoever is sensible”. This is exactly what Helio wants from his members: adulation and submission.</span></span></span></span></p>

And this is precisely the role that they must have. If we look at the not so distant São Paulo Liberal Institute history, we find that it was an Institute created and managed by businessmen and that they had some “success” in reaching the public, whereas it hold events for more than 2.000 people during the 1980’s. However, it isn’t just an irony that one of its exponents and leader of São Paulo Liberal Institute was Eugenio Staub, from Gradiente, was one of the first businessmen to board into Lula presidential race; like that is the fact that Afif Domingos is Dilma Roussef minister. The very Gerdau was Petrobras adviser during these recent dark times. Finally, to be a Mises Brazil donor the businessman must has to understand our purpose, left the intellectual role to intellectuals, take a good care of his businness and to have Faith in the power of ideas to a more free and prosperous society. We are not going to fall in the same mistakes again.</span></span></span></span></p>

Our source always has been Woods, Hoppe, Gordon, Rothbard, Salerno and others from the Mises Institute. There is still too much to be done to build intellectual elite.

Since Mises Brazil beginning any attempt to bring new donors to the Institute frightened Helio and he put a stop on all of them. It was a clear sign that he doesn’t wanted any other donor that could diminish his position inside the Institute. I could mention an episode where we had (and still have) a project to translate important books from the Mises Institute and we would ask Salim Matar for financing it. Helio trembled before this idea and sabotaged systematically this initiative. Anyway, to get back to your question and taking the opportunity I want to say that we are accepting new donor, but now we have learned a lesson: the donor doesn’t take part of the staff, although of having a vital importance.</span></span></span></span></p>

We always had a trusty relationship and a gentlemen agreement. Notwithstanding he insisted on a bureaucratic statute and used to send us uneventful any change in it for us to sign. In one of these there was a clause granting votes for donor according to the amount of money they put in. We signed it without worry, considering it to be a matter of fiscal question, to justify the donations to the IRS. And that was how he cheated us, and thinks he had done it successfully. In fact, all he got only for himself was not the MIses Brazil, but just a CNPJ.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><b>You mentioned “cheating” and lately it was around social media the Roberto Barricelli episode, where he was accused of steal Mises Brazil money.

As soon as Helio expelled us from his “CNPJ” and choose to follow his path away from Mises Brasil (believing he was doing this with Mises Brazil), he hired Barricelli, a despicable figure from the libertarian environment. During the same meeting that he had the breakdown we firmly opposed this action, telling him he would ruin Mises Brazil reputation by doing that. Said and done. IHB had a bad start, but I hope that with all the investment Helio is doing on his academic projects he can overcome this episode. However, what matter is that before Helio, Barricelli is just an apprentice.</span></span></span></span></p>

There are similarities and distinctions. Constantino also wished to transform Mises Brazil in something else. But contrary to the presented situation, Constantino left and over time was able to find a bigger audience to his talent. However Helio lacks talent. Without Mises Brazil he is bound by his limitation. Thus, instead of recognizing Mises Brazil is not what he wants, he strived to modify its nature and purpose. Anyway, Constantino episode is useful to Helio realizes he can success without Mises Brazil.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">– <span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">They don’t, and this gives me the chance to say that we are going to translate this interview to English and clarify this dispute to them, letting anyone interested to know. Furthermore, Helio lied on that interview claiming that Kim Kataguiri is a libertarian (“100% libertarian”, he says) when he gave an analysis of the movements here in Brazil. Kim already reiterated countless times his disparities with libertarianism and nowadays it isn’t open to discussion anymore: he is not a libertarian and we can live with that. Helio’s Reason to lie is something that makes me wonder. Regarding the tribute to Lew, it is only strategy. If Helio actually wished to honor Lew Rockwell, he should start listening his podcast or reading LRC, something he never did. I doubt Helio has ever entered his website. By the way, none of the new IHB members follow, read or listen to Woods, Lew, Hoppe and so on. The C.O.O. and Helio kept saying “think tank” when talking about Mises Brazil, provig that they don’t have a clue aboutthe difference between both things.</span></span></span></span></p>

Bruno is more like an aristocratic intellectual, at its best meaning. I respect his position, but he is not in tune with Mises Brazil. We have canceled his podcast because unfortunately in Brazil there is no human resource enough to keep a show like that running. Bruno must have interviewed 6 or 8 austro-libertarians in his quasi 200 episodes. Besides those, the interviewees were classical liberals or conservatives or not even that.</span></span></span></span></p>

At least there is a little decency left over in him, and clearly states that he is not an autro-libertarian. He never has been and never will be a Mises Brazil member. Only Helio’s muddle head toe ver consider such a thing. Alex went to the last Mises University, but scorn Hoppe and is a kirkian (Russel Kirk follower). Obviously, while in Auburn he didn’t dare to state this out and loud, what would be too shameful. He was there only to take pictures and then dump every Facebook group with spams. However his bussiness is well known: he jumps from Institute to Institute, for as much tie as the money last. Instituto Liberal, Acton, Kirk Center, etc. Now he found a billionaire like Helio (a toady dependent) pouring a fortune into his Institute. His sharpened sense perceived this opportunity. I have to say that none of this prevent him of being savant and capable, although not lined up with Mises Brazil.</span></span></span></span></p>

Marinho is a complete nullity, never have been and never will be a Mises Brazil member for he hardly knows what it is about. He is a liberal agitator and nothing more. Yet, when I see someone like him, I cannot avoid helping, and if I am not going to make of him an austro-libertarian, personally at least I would recommend him not to call “beloved friend” people he barely knows. It not sounds good and expose his falsehood. After all, we cannot wait for decency from an opportunist like that, but another thing he should do if he had any notion about what Mises Brazil is, would be ask for his “book” removal from Helio Institute books. Can anyone imagine Mises Institute Publishing something like that!</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">– <span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">Ubiratan is a university teacher. Here it is important to clarify the huge distinction between an intellectual and a college professor. They are completely different things. To be an university professor is a professional occupation. That being said, it is important to contextualize: in spite of having few professors more or less in tune with the Austrian School, that doesn’t mean they belong to the cultural and intellectual movement started by Rothbard. Professor Mueller would be more in this line. I believe today that Ubiratan is part of Helio plans to influence the academy. However, the fact of be associated or not with the academy always have been irrelevant for Mises Brazil.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">– <span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">I was going to mention him. Barbieri is the perfect example of how this Helio’s institute is far from MI/IMB. Barbieri believes that Peter Boettke (who is not from MI) to be the best Austrian economist in the world. At the same time he thinks that professor Hoppe (a total unanimity among MI associates) to be the worst. This is another emblematic symptom that we are Instituto Mises Brazil and that Helio doesn’t have the slightest idea of what MI/IMB is all about.</span></span></span></span></p>

He is not familiar with the austro libertarian milieu. He is an employee that maybe Helio needs for his institute. Its preposterous for IMB to have a C.O.O. or something like that. Not even the MI has such highest-ranking executive position! This is coming from Helio’s disturbed mind. Only Helio could possibly picture Mises Brazil as a Washington D.C. think tank. I even felt sorry for him when I watched him announcing the Mises Club membership categories. Bruno Garschagen wittily said that they were very similar to Amway’s.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">– <span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">The first thing I did was to ask the members of the Instituto Helio Beltrão if they would be so kind to return the domain from our website and Facebook fanpage and stop bearing our logo. I ask Bruno to change the name of his podcast. I also have asked them to change the name of their magazine. It is evident that without money, our activities will be kept to a minimum scale until we can find sponsors and afford a dedicated and exclusive translator. It is important to emphasize that all Mises Institutes around the world, inspired by our model, have very scarce activities. I used to think that they did not have the good luck that we did, meeting the right billionaire. Now I see that they are much more in touch with reality than we used to be. Books will be the same and soon enough we will provide a “print-on-demand” system. No autographs (laughs). This is also a very important matter: Helio has always wanted a publishing house, what is in disagreement with the model of MI. Mises Institute has hundreds of books, and the majority of them are available online free of charge. The idea of a publishing house is a way of getting track of all the books and to stop the freely dissemination of their contents. I don’t have any doubt in my mind that our public will now be smaller but that doesn’t bother us at all. While Helio has always gone for quantity, we went for quality. And that – most definitely – will no longer be an issue. We will keep the library and the entire content of our site as an open resource.</span></span></span></span></p>

But we are in Brazil. I´ve never had imagined that it would be easy and this is one more difficulty that we need to overcome. We will keep on going and I believe that, in a short period of time, the truthful austro-libertarian public will be able to tell one from the other with perfect clarity.</span></span></span></span></p>
