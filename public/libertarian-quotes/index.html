A politician who portrays himself as "caring" and "sensitive" because he wants to expand the government's charitable programs is merely saying that he's willing to try to do good with other people's money.

They are nations of eternal war. – <em>Thomas Jefferson (1823)</em></li>
 	<li>America does not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all.

 	<li>If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.

 	<li>Let the people think they govern and they will be governed. – <em>William Penn (1693)</em></li>
 	<li>In 1940, teachers were asked what they regarded as the three major problems in American schools. They identified the three major problems as: Littering, noise, and chewing gum.

 	<li>This country is a one-party country. Half of it is called Republican and half is called Democrat. It doesn't make any difference. All the really good ideas belong to the Libertarians. – <em>Hugh Downs (1997)</em></li>
 	<li>Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. –<em>Lord Acton (1887)</em></li>
 	<li>Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. – <em>Mao Zedong (1938)</em></li>

 	<li>There never was a good war or a bad peace. – <em>Benjamin Franklin (1773)</em></li>
 	<li>Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption of authority.

 	<li>It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from regard to their own interest.

Nobody but a beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow citizens. –<em>Adam Smith, "The Wealth of Nations"</em></li>
 	<li>Democracy is a pathetic belief in the collective wisdom of individual ignorance. – <em>L. Mencken</em></li>
 	<li>Collectivism doesn't work because it's based on a faulty economic premise. There is no such thing as a person's "fair share" of wealth. The gross national product is not a pizza that must be carefully divided because if I get too many slices, you have to eat the box. The economy is expandable and, in any practical sense, limitless. – <em> J. O'Rourke, "How to Explain Conservatism"</em></li>
 	<li>Government cannot make man richer, but it can make him poorer. –<em>Ludwig von Mises</em></li>
 	<li>The national budget must be balanced. The public debt must be reduced; the arrogance of the authorities must be moderated and controlled. Payments to foreign governments must be reduced.

 	<li>Left-wing politicians take away your liberty in the name of children and of fighting poverty, while right-wing politicians do it in the name of family values and fighting drugs. Either way, government gets bigger and you become less free. – <em>Harry Browne</em></li>

Well what if he neglect the care of his health or his estate, which would more nearly relate to the state. Will the magistrate make a law that he not be poor or sick? Laws provide against injury from others; but not from ourselves. God himself will not save men against their wills. – <em>Thomas Jefferson</em></li>
 	<li>America's abundance was not created by public sacrifices to the common good, but by the productive genius of free men who pursued their own personal interests and the making of their own private fortunes. – <em>Ayn Rand</em></li>

He intends only his own gain, and he is, in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was not part of his intention. – <em>Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations</em></li>
 	<li>The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept, and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, as well as its interpretation by every major commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratification, indicates that what is protected is an individual right of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner. – <em>Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, 97th Congress, Second Session (February 1982)</em></li>

 	<li>Virtually all reasonable laws are obeyed, not because they are the law, but because reasonable people would do that anyway. If you obey a law simply because it is the law, that's a pretty likely sign that it shouldn't be a law. – <em>Unknown</em></li>
 	<li>The U.S. Constitution may be flawed, but it's a whole lot better than what we have now. – <em>Unknown</em></li>
 	<li>The welfare state reduces a citizen to a client, subordinates them to a bureaucrat, and subjects them to rules that are anti-work, anti-family, anti-opportunity and anti-property … Humans forced to suffer under such anti-human rules naturally develop pathologies. The evening news is the natural result of the welfare state. – <em>Unknown</em></li>
 	<li>I do not believe that the government should have its long nose poked into the private consensual relationships between people. – <em>John Anderson, Independent presidential candidate, 1980</em></li>

 	<li>Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the government's purposes are beneficial … the greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well meaning but without understanding. – <em>Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis, 1928</em></li>
 	<li>Tariffs, quotas and other import restrictions protect the business of the rich at the expense of high cost of living for the poor. Their intent is to deprive you of the right to choose, and to force you to buy the high-priced inferior products of politically favored companies. – <em>Alan Burris, "A Liberty Primer"</em></li>
 	<li>Perhaps the removal of trade restrictions throughout the world would do more for the cause of universal peace than can any political union of peoples separated by trade barriers. – <em>Frank Chodorov</em></li>

 	<li>I think the terror most people are concerned with is the IRS. – <em>Malcolm Forbes, when asked if he was afraid of terrorism</em></li>
 	<li>Let the people decide through the marketplace mechanism what they wish to see and hear. Why is there this national obsession to tamper with this box of transistors and tubes when we don't do the same for Time magazine? – <em>Mark Fowler, FCC Chairman</em></li>
 	<li>The usual road to slavery is that first they take away your guns, then they take away your property, then last of all they tell you to shut up and say you are enjoying it. – <em>James A. Donald</em></li>
 	<li>Every friend of freedom must be as revolted as I am by the prospect of turning the United States into an armed camp, by the vision of jails filled with casual drug users and of an army of enforcers empowered to invade the liberty of citizens on slight evidence. – <em>Milton Friedman, Nobel Prize-winning economist</em></li>
 	<li>The high rate of unemployment among teenagers, and especially black teenagers, is both a scandal and a serious source of social unrest. Yet it is largely a result of minimum wage laws. We regard the minimum wage law as one of the most, if not the most, anti-black laws on the statute books. – <em>Milton Friedman, Nobel Prize-winning economist</em></li>

 	<li>Those who do not learn from the mistakes of history are doomed to repeat them. – <em>George Santayana</em></li>

 	<li>There are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by the gradual and silent encroachment of those in power, than by violent and sudden usurpation. – <em>James Madison</em></li>
 	<li>Taxation of earnings from labor is on a par with forced labor. Seizing the results of someone's labor is equivalent to seizing hours from him and directing him to carry on various activities. – <em>Robert Nozick, Harvard philosopher</em></li>
 	<li>Alcohol didn't cause the high crime rates of the '20s and '30s, Prohibition did. And drugs do not cause today's alarming crime rates, but drug prohibition does. – <em>US District Judge James C. Paine, addressing the Federal Bar Association in Miami, November, 1991</em></li>

 	<li>There are many farm handouts; but let's call them what they really are: a form of legalized theft. Essentially, a congressman tells his farm constituency, "Vote for me. I'll use my office to take another American's money and give it to you." – <em>Walter Williams, economist and syndicated columnist</em></li>
 	<li>National Health Insurance means combining the efficiency of the Postal Service with the compassion of the I.R.S. … and the cost accounting of the Pentagon. – <em>Louis Sullivan/Connie Horner quoted by Novak in _Forbes_</em></li>

 	<li>Show me a movement that doesn't hate somebody and I will join it at once. – <em>Robert Anton Wilson</em></li>

 	<li>One of the annoying things about believing in free will and individual responsibility is the difficulty of finding somebody to blame your problems on. And when you do find somebody, it's remarkable how often his picture turns up on your driver's license. – <em>J. O'Rourke</em></li>
 	<li>You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves. – <em>Abraham Lincoln</em></li>

 	<li>A man should be upright, not be kept upright. – <em>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus</em></li>
 	<li>Can any of you seriously say the Bill of Rights could get through Congress today? It wouldn't even get out of committee. – <em> Lee Bailey</em></li>

 	<li>Everyone wants to live at the expense of the State. They forget that the State lives at the expense of everyone. – <em>Frédéric Bastiat</em></li>
 	<li>People fear witches, and burn women. – <em>Justice Louis Brandeis</em></li>
 	<li>The American heritage was one of individual liberty, personal responsibility and freedom from government … Unfortunately … that heritage has been lost. Americans no longer have the freedom to direct their own lives … Today, it is the government that is free – free to do whatever it wants. There is no subject, no issue, no matter … that is not subject to legislation. – <em>Harry Browne</em></li>

 	<li>The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed. – <em>Alexander Hamilton</em></li>

 	<li>Low-income workers as a group are the major victims of minimum wage legislation. – <em>Keith B. Leffler</em></li>
 	<li>Prohibition goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation and makes crimes out of things that are not crimes. A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded. – <em>Abraham Lincoln</em></li>

 	<li>Depressions and mass unemployment are not caused by the free market but by government interference in the economy. – <em>Ludwig von Mises</em></li>
 	<li>When they took the 4th Amendment, I was quiet because I didn't deal drugs.
When they took the 6th Amendment, I was quiet because I am innocent.
When they took the 2nd Amendment, I was quiet because I don't own a gun.
Now they have taken the 1st Amendment, and I can only be quiet. – <em>Lyle Myhr</em></li>
 	<li>In Germany, they first came for the communists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a communist. Then, they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew … Then they came for the Catholics. I didn't speak up then because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak up. – <em>Reverend Martin Niemoller, German Lutheran pastor arrested by the Gestapo in 1937.</em></li>

 	<li>Petty laws breed great crimes. – <em>Ouida</em></li>
 	<li>The essential psychological requirement of a free society is the willingness on the part of the individual to accept responsibility for his life. – <em>Edith Packer</em></li>

 	<li>The course of history shows that as a government grows, liberty decreases. – <em>Thomas Jefferson</em></li>
 	<li>The most important element of a free society, where individual rights are held in the highest esteem, is the rejection of the initiation of violence. All initiation of force is a violation of someone else's rights, whether initiated by an individual or the state, for the benefit of an individual or group of individuals, even if it's supposed to be for the benefit of another individual or group of individuals. Legitimate use of violence can only be that which is required in self-defense. – <em>Congressman Ron Paul, (R) Texas</em></li>

 	<li>Things in our country run in spite of government, not by aid of it. – <em>Will Rogers</em></li>
 	<li>I am convinced that we can do to guns what we've done to drugs: create a multi-billion dollar underground market over which we have absolutely no control. – <em>George L. Roman</em></li>
 	<li>The old parties are husks, with no real soul within either, divided on artificial lines, boss-ridden and privilege-controlled, each a jumble of incongruous elements, and neither daring to speak out wisely and fearlessly on what should be said on the vital issues of the day. – <em>Theodore Roosevelt</em></li>
 	<li>Laws do not persuade just because they threaten. – <em>Seneca</em></li>
 	<li>Armed people are free. No state can control those who have the machinery and the will to resist, no mob can take their liberty and property. And no 220-pound thug can threaten the well-being or dignity of a 110-pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out … People who object to weapons aren't abolishing violence, they're begging for rule by brute force, when the biggest, strongest animals among men were always automatically "right." Guns ended that, and a social democracy is a hollow farce without an armed populace to make it work. – <em> Neil Smith (from The Probability Broach)</em></li>
 	<li>Let him who would move the world, first move himself. – <em>Socrates</em></li>
 	<li>What is ominous is the ease with which some people go from saying that they don't like something to saying that the government should forbid it. When you go down that road, don't expect freedom to survive very long. – <em>Thomas Sowell</em></li>
 	<li>The only tyrant I accept in this world is the still voice within. – <em>Mohandas Gandhi</em></li>
 	<li>However insignificant the minority, and however trifling the proposed trespass against their rights, no such trespass is permissible. – <em>Herbert Spencer (from "The Right To Ignore The State")</em></li>
 	<li>The highwayman takes solely upon himself the responsibility, danger, and crime of his own act. He does not pretend that he has any rightful claim to your money, or that he intends to use it for your own benefit … Furthermore, having taken your money, he leaves you, as you wish him to do … He does not keep "protecting" you by commanding you to bow down and serve him; by requiring you to do this, and forbidding you to do that. – <em>Lysander Spooner</em></li>
 	<li>If I were a Brazilian without land or money or the means to feed my children, I would be burning the rain forest too. – <em>Sting</em></li>
 	<li>I favor free trade in drugs for the same reason the Founding Fathers favored free trade in ideas: in a free society it is none of the government's business what ideas a man puts into his mind; likewise, it should be none of its business what drugs he puts into his body. – <em>Thomas Szasz</em></li>
 	<li>That government is best which governs least. – <em>Henry David Thoreau</em></li>
 	<li>In the beginning of a change, the Patriot is a scarce man and brave, hated and scorned. When his cause succeeds however, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be a Patriot. – <em>Mark Twain</em></li>
 	<li>I love my country far too much to be a nationalist. – <em>Unknown</em></li>
 	<li>I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. – <em>Voltaire</em></li>
 	<li>If even one new drug of the stature of penicillin or digitalis has been unjustifiably banished to a company's back shelf because of exceedingly stringent regulatory requirements, that event will have harmed more people than all the toxicity that has occurred in the history of modern drug development. – <em>William Wardell</em></li>
 	<li>It rankles me when somebody tries to force somebody to do something. – <em>John Wayne</em></li>
 	<li>Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any body of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. – <em>Noah Webster</em></li>
 	<li>Only in a police state is the job of a policeman easy. – <em>Orson Welles</em></li>
 	<li>Liberals believe government should take people's earnings to give to poor people. Conservatives disagree. They think government should confiscate people's earnings and give them to farmers and insolvent banks. The compelling issue to both conservatives and liberals is not whether it is legitimate for government to confiscate one's property to give to another, the debate is over the disposition of the pillage. – <em>Walter Williams</em></li>
 	<li>Taking somebody's money without permission is stealing, unless you work for the IRS; then it's taxation. Killing people en masse is homicidal mania, unless you work for the Army; then it's National Defense. Spying on your neighbors is invasion of privacy, unless you work for the FBI; then it's National Security. Running a whorehouse makes you a pimp and poisoning people makes you a murderer, unless you work for the CIA; then it's counter-intelligence. – <em>Robert Anton Wilson</em></li>
 	<li>Government, in it's last analysis, is organized force. – <em>Woodrow Wilson</em></li>
 	<li>Any fool can make a rule, and every fool will mind it. – <em>Cousin Woodman</em></li>
 	<li>The proper direction of man's thought is not toward the creation of new laws for government, but toward the acceptance of every person's moral dignity. – <em>Edmund Yates</em></li>
 	<li>The higher entry standards imposed by licensing laws reduce the supply of professional services … The poor are the net losers, because the availability of low-cost service has been reduced. In essence, the poor subsidize the information research costs of the rich. – <em> David Young</em></li>
 	<li>The pages of history shine on instances of the jury's exercise of its prerogative to disregard instructions of the judge. – <em>S. vs. Dougherty, 1972</em></li>
 	<li>The people of the various provinces are strictly forbidden to have in their possession any swords, bows, spears, firearms or other types of arms. The possession of these elements makes difficult the collection of taxes and dues, and tends to permit uprising. – <em>Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Japanese Shogun, August 29, 1558</em></li>
 	<li>We ask that the government undertake the obligation above all of providing citizens with adequate opportunity for employment and earning a living. The activities of the individual must not be allowed to clash with the interests of the community, but must take place within its confines and be for the good of all. Therefore, we demand: … an end to the power of the financial interests. We demand profit sharing in big business. We demand a broad extension of care for the aged. We demand … the greatest possible consideration of small business in the purchases of national, state, and municipal governments. In order to make possible to every capable and industrious [citizen] the attainment of higher education and thus the achievement of a post of leadership, the government must provide an all-around enlargement of our entire system of public education … We demand the education at government expense of gifted children of poor parents … The government must undertake the improvement of public health – by protecting mother and child, by prohibiting child labor … by the greatest possible support for all clubs concerned with the physical education of youth. We combat the … materialistic spirit within and without us, and are convinced that a permanent recovery of our people can only proceed from within on the foundation of the common good before the individual good. – <em>From the political program of the Nazi Party, adopted in Munich, February 24, 1920</em></li>

 	<li>Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain. – <em>The Wizard of Oz</em></li>
 	<li>People who create things nowadays can expect to be prosecuted by highly moralistic people who are incapable of creating anything. There is no way to measure the chilling effect on innovation that results from the threats of taxation, regulation and prosecution against anything that succeeds. We'll never know how many ideas our government has aborted in the name protecting us. – <em>Joseph Sobran May 13, 1998 (commenting on US vs Microsoft)</em></li>
 	<li>I believe the states can best govern our home concerns and the federal government our foreign ones. – <em>Thomas Jefferson</em></li>
 	<li>It took about 150 years, starting with a Bill of Rights that reserved to the states and the people all powers not explicitly delegated to the federal government, to produce a Supreme Court willing to rule that growing corn to feed to your own hogs is interstate commerce and can therefore be regulated by Congress. – <em>David Friedman, The Machinery of Freedom</em></li>
 	<li>I regret to say that we of the FBI are powerless to act in cases of oral-genital intimacy, unless it has in some way obstructed interstate commerce. – <em> Edgar Hoover</em></li>
 	<li>First, God created idiots. That was just for practice. Then He created school boards. – <em>Mark Twain</em></li>
 	<li>The politician attempts to remedy the evil by increasing the very thing that caused the evil in the first place: legal plunder. – <em>Frédéric Bastiat</em></li>
 	<li>The police can't stop an intruder, mugger, or stalker from hurting you. They can pursue him only after he has hurt or killed you. Protecting yourself from harm is your responsibility, and you are far less likely to be hurt in a neighborhood of gun-owners than in one of disarmed citizens – even if you don't own a gun yourself. – <em>Harry Browne</em></li>
 	<li>The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. – <em>Edmund Burke</em></li>
 	<li>Patriotism means loving our country, not the government. – <em>Michael Cloud</em></li>
 	<li>Conservatives and liberals are kindred spirits as far as government spending is concerned. First, let's make sure we understand what government spending is. Since government has no resources of its own, and since there's no Tooth Fairy handing Congress the funds for the programs it enacts, we are forced to recognize that government spending is no less than the confiscation of one person's property to give it to another to whom it does not belong – in effect, legalized theft. – <em>Walter Williams</em></li>
 	<li>The Constitution is not neutral. It was designed to take the government off the backs of people. – <em>Justice William O. Douglas</em></li>
 	<li>The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by the Prohibition law. For nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced. It is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in this country is closely connected with this. – <em>Albert Einstein</em></li>
 	<li>I'm in favor of legalizing drugs. According to my value system, if people want to kill themselves, they have every right to do so. Most of the harm that comes from drugs is because they are illegal. –<em>Milton Friedman</em></li>
 	<li>One who uses coercion is guilty of deliberate violence. Coercion is inhuman. – <em>Mohandas Gandhi</em></li>
 	<li>The policy of the American government is to leave their citizens free, neither restraining nor aiding them in their pursuits. – <em>Thomas Jefferson</em></li>
 	<li>There comes a time when a moral man can't obey a law which his conscience tells him is unjust. – <em>Martin Luther King, Jr.</em></li>
 	<li>The greater the number of laws and enactments, the more thieves and robbers there will be. – <em>Lao Tsu</em></li>
 	<li>You know, if government were a product, selling it would be illegal. Government is a health hazard. Governments have killed many more people than cigarettes or unbuckled seat belts ever have. – <em>J. O'Rourke</em></li>
 	<li>A body of men holding themselves accountable to nobody ought not to be trusted by anybody. – <em>Thomas Paine</em></li>
 	<li>Wealth comes from successful individual efforts to please one's fellow man … that's what competition is all about: "outpleasing" your competitors to win over the consumers. – <em>Walter Williams</em></li>
 	<li>To me, it doesn't matter if your scapegoats are the Jews, the homosexuals, the male sex, the Masons, the Jesuits, the Welfare Parasites, the Power Elite, the female sex, the vegetarians, or the Communist Party. To the extent that you need a scapegoat, you simply have not got your brain programmed to work as an efficient problem-solving machine. – <em>Robert Anton Wilson</em></li>
 	<li>A strong body makes a strong mind. As to the species of exercise I advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body it gives boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Let your gun, therefore, be the constant companion of your walks. –<em>Thomas Jefferson</em></li>
 	<li>The World's Smallest Political Quiz is the single best outreach tool we libertarians have. –<em>George Getz, Libertarian Party press secretary</em></li>
 	<li>Gun control? It's the best thing you can do for crooks and gangsters. I want you to have nothing. If I'm a bad guy, I'm always gonna have a gun. Safety locks? You will pull the trigger with a lock on, and I'll pull the trigger. We'll see who wins. –<em>Sammy "The Bull" Gravano, whose testimony convicted John Gotti</em></li>
 	<li>Those who cast the votes decide nothing. Those who count the votes decide everything. –<em>Josef V. Stalin</em></li>
 	<li>In our desire to have government become our benefactor and sustainer, we have allowed it to become our taskmaster and overlord. As a result, we have become little more than well-fed, well-entertained slaves to the state. Freedom, as envisioned by our forefathers, is gone. –<em>Chuck Baldwin 2001 (www.chuckbaldwinlive.com)</em></li>
 	<li>To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them. –<em>Richard Henry Lee (who drafted the Second Amendment as well as the rest of the Bill of Rights) 1788</em></li>
 	<li>Faced with the pain of freedom, man begs for his shackles. –<em>Gerry Spence</em></li>
 	<li>I say that the Second Amendment doesn't allow for exceptions – or else it would have read that the right "to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, unless Congress chooses otherwise." And because there are no exceptions, I disagree with my fellow panelists who say the existing gun laws should be enforced. Those laws are unconstitutional [and] wrong – because they put you at a disadvantage to armed criminals, to whom the laws are no inconvenience. –<em>Harry Browne, meetings with NRA's EVP, Wayne LaPierre and other panelists at a gun rights rally in Hot Springs, AR, 8/8/2000</em></li>
 	<li>The angels and the devils are definitely within us, not within the machines we use. –<em>Michael Dertouzos</em></li>

 	<li>Gradualism in theory is perpetuity in practice. –<em>William Lloyd Garrison</em></li>
 	<li>The only thing that saves us from bureaucracy is its inefficiency. –<em>Eugene McCarthy</em></li>
 	<li>The jury has the right to judge both the law as well as the fact in controversy. –<em>John Jay, Joint-author of the Federalist Papers and first U. S. Supreme Court Chief Justice</em></li>
 	<li>There ain't no rules around here! We're trying to accomplish something. –<em>Thomas Edison</em></li>
 	<li>The ideal Government of all reflective men, from Aristotle onward, is one which lets the individual alone – one which barely escapes being no government at all. –<em> L. Mencken</em></li>
 	<li>Most economic fallacies derive … from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie, that one party can gain only at the expense of another. –<em>Milton Friedman, Economic Freedom and Representative Government; 1973</em></li>
 	<li>Freedom is essentially a condition of inequality, not equality. It recognizes as a fact of nature the structural differences inherent in man – in temperament, character, and capacity – and it respects those differences. We are not alike and no law can make us so. –<em>Frank Chodorov</em></li>
 	<li>When government accepts responsibility for people, then people no longer take responsibility for themselves. –<em>George Pataki</em></li>
 	<li>Freedom is a fragile thing and is never more than one generation away from extinction. –<em>Ronald Reagan</em></li>
 	<li>The cure for evil and disorder is more liberty, not suppression. –<em>Alexander Berkman</em></li>
 	<li>Live and let live. –<em>Friedrich von Schiller</em></li>
 	<li>The most dangerous man to any government is the man who is able to think things out for himself, without regard to the prevailing superstitions and taboos. Almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion that the government he lives under is dishonest, insane, and intolerable … –<em> L. Mencken</em></li>
 	<li>It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees. –<em>Emiliano Zapta, Mexican revolutionary</em></li>
 	<li>The times call for courage. The times call for hard work. But if the demands are high, it is because the stakes are even higher. They are nothing less than the future of human liberty, which means the future of civilization. –<em>Henry Hazlitt</em></li>
 	<li>Blacks were not enslaved because they were black but because they were available. Slavery has existed in the world for thousands of years. Whites enslaved other whites in Europe for centuries before the first black was brought to the Western hemisphere. Asians enslaved Europeans. Asians enslaved other Asians. Africans enslaved other Africans, and indeed even today in North Africa, blacks continue to enslave blacks. –<em>Thomas Sowell, a black sociologist, author and columnist</em></li>
 	<li>To sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards of men. –<em>Abraham Lincoln</em></li>
 	<li>These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as Freedom should not be highly rated. –<em>Thomas Paine</em></li>
 	<li>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. –<em>The Declaration of Independence</em></li>
 	<li>Truth is not only violated by falsehood; it may be equally outraged by silence. –<em>Henri Frederic Amiel</em></li>
 	<li>Liberty is always unfinished business. –<em>Anonymous</em></li>
 	<li>And now that the legislators and do gooders have futilely inflicted so many systems upon society, may they finally end where they should have begun: May they reject all systems. And try liberty … –<em>Frederic Bastiat, 1850</em></li>
 	<li>Everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders; no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others. And no one can find a safe way out for himself if society is sweeping towards destruction. Therefore, everyone, in his own interests, must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual battle. None can stand aside with unconcern; the interests of everyone hangs on the results. Whether he chooses or not, every man is drawn into the greatest historical struggle, the decisive battle into which our epoch has plunged us. –<em>Ludwig von Mises</em></li>
 	<li>If our country is to survive and prosper, we must summon the courage to condemn and reject the liberal agenda, and we had better do it soon. –<em>Walter E. Williams, "The Gathering Racial Tragedy"</em></li>
 	<li>I think we need to find out why the citizens of the world's wealthiest, most envied, most powerful country are so cynical, so distressed, so angry, so ticked of about so many things. –<em>William J. Bennett, former Secretary of Education.</em></li>
 	<li>If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face – forever. –<em>George Orwell, 1984</em></li>
 	<li>Not only can no one predict the future, we don't understand the present – and there isn't even any certainty about the past. –<em>Harry Browne</em></li>
 	<li>A man who walks down the centre line of a road risks getting hit from both sides. –<em>Alexander Ziatanovic</em></li>
 	<li>It ain't so much what a man doesn't know that causes him so many problems, but what he knows that ain't so. –<em>Will Rogers</em></li>
 	<li>To take what there is, and use it, without waiting forever in vain for the preconceived – to dig deep into the actual and get something out of it – this doubtless is the right way to live. –<em>Henry James</em></li>
 	<li>The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose. –<em>Shakespeare</em></li>
 	<li>Men are most apt to believe what they least understand. –<em>Montaigne</em></li>
 	<li>When a well-packaged web of lies has been sold gradually to the masses over generations, the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic. –<em>Dresden James</em></li>
 	<li>I have thought that a man of tolerable abilities may work great changes if he first forms a good plan and makes the execution of that same plan his whole study and business. –<em>Benjamin Franklin</em></li>
 	<li>For all the sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these, "It might have been!" –<em>John Greenleaf Whittier</em></li>
 	<li>It takes time to ruin a world, but time is all it takes. –<em>Bernard DeFoutenelle</em></li>

 	<li>After you've heard two eyewitness accounts of an auto accident, it makes you wonder about history. –<em>Bits &amp; Pieces</em></li>
 	<li>A nation which does not remember what it was yesterday does not know where it is today. –<em>Robert E. Lee</em></li>
 	<li>Ever since its founding in 1913, the Fed has described itself as an "independent" agency operated by selfless public servants striving to "fine-tune" the economy through monetary policy. In reality, however, a non-political governmental institution is as likely as a barking cat. –<em>Thomas J. DiLorenzo</em></li>
 	<li>I do not deny the allegation, I deny the allegator. –<em>Jesse Jackson [!]</em></li>
 	<li>Those who take the most from the table, teach contentment. Those for whom the taxes are destined, demand sacrifice. Those who eat their fill, speak to the hungry, of wonderful times to come. Those who lead the country into the abyss, call ruling difficult, for ordinary folk. –<em>Bertolt Brecht</em></li>
 	<li>The worst forms of tyranny, or certainly the most successful ones, are not those we rail against but those that so insinuate themselves into the imagery of our consciousness, and the fabric of our lives, as not to be perceived as tyranny. –<em>Michael Parenti</em></li>
 	<li>Any story sounds true until someone tells the other side and sets the record straight. –<em>Proverbs 18:17</em></li>
 	<li>War is peace; freedom is slavery; ignorance is strength. –<em>George Orwell</em></li>
 	<li>The Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect. –<em>George Orwell, 1984</em></li>
 	<li>For the totalitarian mind, adherence to state propaganda does not suffice: one must display proper enthusiasm while marching in the parade. –<em>Noam Chomsky</em></li>
 	<li>Restriction of free thought and free speech is the most dangerous of all subversions. It is the one un-American act that could most easily defeat us all. –<em>Justice William O. Douglas</em></li>

 	<li>The man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but the newspapers. –<em>Thomas Jefferson</em></li>
 	<li>When the mass media in some foreign countries serve as megaphones for the rhetoric of their government, the result is ludicrous propaganda. When the mass media in our country serve as megaphones for the rhetoric of the U.S. government, the result is responsible journalism. –<em>Norman Solomon</em></li>
 	<li>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. –<em>Second Amendment to the Constitution</em></li>
 	<li>An armed society is a polite society. –<em>Robert A. Heinlein</em></li>
 	<li>The aim of public education is not to spread enlightenment at all, it is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and originality. –<em>H L. Mencken</em></li>
 	<li>We must remember that government, no matter how hard it tries, cannot protect an individual from themselves. This legislation is simply one more attempt by big government to tell us that they know what is best for us. It is not the first time and it will not be the last. –<em>Peter Calcagno</em></li>
 	<li>Washington is not America. It has become an alien city-state that rules America, and much of the rest of the world, in the way that Rome ruled the Roman Empire. –<em>Richard Maybury</em></li>
 	<li>How fortunate for governments that the people they administer don't think. –<em>Adolf Hitler</em></li>
 	<li>Now that I look back, I realize that a life predicated on being obedient is a very comfortable life indeed. Living in such a way reduces to a minimum one's own need to think. –<em>Adolf Eichmann, Memoirs written after his 1960 capture by Israel.</em></li>
 	<li>A man's home may be his castle, but that does not keep the government from taking it. –<em>United States v. Hendler, 952 F2d 1364 (Fed Cir 1991)</em></li>
 	<li>Arbitrary power is most easily established on the ruins of liberty abused to licentiousness. –<em>George Washington</em></li>
 	<li>A State which dwarfs its men, in order that they may be more docile instruments in its hands even for beneficial purposes – will find that with small men no great thing can really be accomplished. –<em>John Stuart Mill</em></li>
 	<li>The more power a government has the more it can act arbitrarily according to the whims and desires of the elite, and the more it will make war on others and murder its foreign and domestic subjects. The more constrained the power of governments, the more power is diffused, checked, and balanced, the less it will aggress on others and commit democide. –<em> J. Rummel, Death by Government</em></li>
 	<li>A nation that expects the government to prevent churches from burning, to control the price of bread or gasoline, to secure every job, and to find some villain for every dramatic accident risks an even larger loss of life and liberty. –<em>William A. Niskanen, For a Less Responsive Government, Cato Policy Report,</em></li>
 	<li>The state calls its own violence law, but that of the individual crime. –<em>Max Stirner</em></li>
 	<li>The pattern is as old as human life. The new rulers use more and more force, more police, more soldiers, trying to enforce more efficient control, trying to make the planned economy work by piling regulations on regulations, decree on decree. The people are hungry and hungrier. And how does a man on this earth get butter? Doesn't the government give butter? But government does not produce food from the earth; Government is guns. It is one common distinction of all civilized peoples, that they give their guns to the Government. Men in Government monopolize the necessary use of force; they are not using their energies productively; they are not milking cows. To get butter, they must use guns; they have nothing else to use. –<em>Rose Wilder Lane</em></li>
 	<li>The state is a force incarnate. Worse, it is the silly parading of force. It never seeks to prevail by persuasion. Whenever it thrusts its finger into anything it does so in the most unfriendly way. Its essence is command and compulsion. –<em>Michael Bakunin</em></li>
 	<li>In every State, the government is nothing but a permanent conspiracy on the part of the minority against the majority, which it enslaves and fleeces. –<em>Michael Bakunin</em></li>
 	<li>We are going to tax and tax, spend and spend, elect and elect. –<em>Franklin D. Roosevelt</em></li>

 	<li>In levying taxes and in shearing sheep, it is well to stop when you get down to the skin. –<em>Austin O'Malley</em></li>
 	<li>Public works are not accomplished by the miraculous power of a magic wand. They are paid for by funds taken away from the citizens. –<em>Ludwig von Mises</em></li>
 	<li>A [tax loophole is] something that benefits the other guy. If it benefits you, it is tax reform. –<em>Russell B. Long</em></li>
 	<li>[S]tatism is but socialized dishonesty; it is feathering the nests of some with feathers coercively plucked from others – on the grand scale. There is no moral difference between the act of a pickpocket and the progressive income tax or any other social program. –<em>Leonard Read</em></li>
 	<li>There's another major hurdle to a new year of prosperity: our tax code. No human being understands it. The current code, which runs over 8,000 pages and countless thousands more pages of IRS rulings and interpretations, is beyond redemption. ..Incalculable amounts of the nation's intellectual brainpower are devoted to the dead-end task of coping with the current tax code. Over one-half million people in the U.S. make their living off it, whether in lobbying, lawyering, tax preparing, or accounting. … Americans spend five and one-half billion hours a year filling out tax forms … and spend between $100 billion and $300 billion to comply with the current code. –<em>Malcolm S. Forbes,</em></li>
 	<li>In increasing numbers, Americans believe that it is the responsibility – nay, the duty – of the federal government to take the earnings of some Americans and redistribute them to other Americans for various and sundry "good" reasons including "fairness." Citizens who know it is wrong to use force to take money from a neighbor have rationalized that it is OK for the government to do it for them. –<em>Linda Bowles, nationally syndicated columnist</em></li>
 	<li>The average family pays more in taxes than it spends on food, clothing, and shelter combined. –<em>Congressman Dick Armey, Why a Flat Tax? </em><em>Durell Journal of Money and Banking, Spring 1995</em></li>
 	<li>The control of the production of wealth is the control of human life itself. –<em>Hilaire Belloc</em></li>
 	<li>How ever sugarcoated and ambiguous, every form of authoritarianism must start with a belief in some group's greater right to power, whether that right is justified by sex, race, religion or all four. –<em>Gloria Steinem, American feminist</em></li>
 	<li>Opium and morphine are certainly dangerous, habit-forming drugs. But once the principle is admitted that it is the duty of the government to protect the individual against his own foolishness, no serious objections can be advanced against further encroachments … Is not the harm a man can inflict on his mind and soul even more disastrous than any bodily evils.? Why not prevent him from reading bad books and bad plays, from looking at bad paintings and statues and from hearing bad music? The mischief done by bad ideologies, surely, is much more pernicious both for the individual and for the whole society, than that done by narcotic drugs. –<em>Von Mises, Human Action</em></li>
 	<li>The present struggle seems less about abolishing big government than about who gets to use it. –<em>William Greider, One World Ready or Not</em></li>

 	<li>One of the things the government can't do is run anything. The only things our government runs are the post office and the railroads, and both of them are bankrupt. –<em>Lee Iacocca</em></li>
 	<li>With all that IMF money, the Thailand's and Mexico's are spared the consequences of their fiscal incompetence, and Wall Street's heavy hitters are spared the consequences of their stupid investments. The global economy is a rigged game, rigged so Third World politicians, rich investors and global corporations win – and U.S. taxpayers lose. –<em>Patrick J. Buchanan</em></li>
 	<li>Every actual State is corrupt. Good men must not obey the laws too well. –<em>Ralph Waldo Emerson</em></li>
 	<li>A union of government and religion tends to destroy government and degrade religion. –<em>Hugo Black</em></li>
 	<li>If you're going to sin, sin against God, not the bureaucracy. God will forgive you but the bureaucracy won't. –<em>Hyman G. Rickover</em></li>
 	<li>If we do not halt this steady process of building commissions and regulatory bodies and the special legislation like huge inverted pyramids over every one of the simple constitutional provisions, we shall soon be spending many billions of dollars more. –<em>Franklin D. Roosevelt</em></li>
 	<li>The proper and limited use of government is to invoke a common justice and keep the peace – and that is all. –<em>Leonard Read</em></li>
 	<li>I am not a friend to a very energetic government. It is always oppressive. –<em>Thomas Jefferson</em></li>
 	<li>The bureaucrat's first objective, of course, is preservation of his job – provided by the big-government system, at the taxpayers expense. … Whether real world problems get solved or not is of secondary importance. It doesn't take much cynicism, in fact, to see that the bureaucrats have a vested interest in not having problems solved. If the problems did not exist (or had been invented), there would be no reason for the bureaucrat to have a job" –<em>William Simon, former U.S Treasury Secretary</em></li>
 	<li>What is so bad about big government? My indictment of big government is that it is bad because it attacks liberty, prosperity, progress, harmony, and morality. Thanks to big government, we have significantly less of all of those good things than we would if we had been able to keep government right-sized. Big government is cancerous. Like a cancer, it hurts the body and tends to spread, doing more and more harm as it grows. It is time for some radical surgery. –<em>George C. Leef, director of FEE's Freeman Society Discussion Clubs</em></li>

 	<li>A bureaucrat is the most despicable of men, though he is needed as vultures are needed, but one hardly admires vultures whom bureaucrats so strangely resemble. I have yet to meet a bureaucrat who was not petty, dull, almost witless, crafty or stupid, an oppressor or a thief, a holder of little authority in which he delights, as a boy delights in possessing a vicious dog. Who can trust such creatures? –<em>Cicero</em></li>
 	<li>You can't give the government the power to do good without also giving it the power to do bad – in fact, to do anything it wants. –<em>Harry Browne</em></li>
 	<li>Once upon a time, government budgets were balanced, our money was sound, the streets were safe, and taxes imposed by all levels of government took less than 10% of our income. –<em>Harry Browne</em></li>
 	<li>Through an unwieldy combination of big government, big military, big business, big labor and big cities, we have created an unworkable mega-nation which defies central management and control. Not only is the United States too big, but it has also become too authoritarian and too undemocratic, and its states assume too little responsibility for the solution of their own social, economic, and political problems. –<em> Thomas Naylor, professor emeritus of economics at Duke University</em></li>
 	<li>The greater the power, the more dangerous the abuse. –<em>Edmund Burke</em></li>
 	<li>Those who have been once intoxicated with power, and have derived any kind of emolument from it, even though but for one year, can never willingly abandon it. –<em>Edmund Burke</em></li>
 	<li>The power which a multiple millionaire, who may be my neighbor and perhaps my employer, has over me is very much less than that which the smallest "functionaire" possesses who wields the coercive power of the state, and on whose desecration it depends whether and how I am allowed to live or to work. –<em>Frederich von Hayek, The Road to Serfdom</em></li>
 	<li>Of all 36 ways to get out of trouble, the best way is – leave. –<em>Chinese Proverb</em></li>
 	<li>Few of us can easily surrender our belief that society must somehow make sense. The thought that the State has lost its mind and is punishing so many innocent people is intolerable. And so the evidence has to be internally denied. –<em>Arthur Miller</em></li>
 	<li>Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from mistaken conviction. –<em>Blaise Pascal</em></li>
 	<li>Bad laws are the worst sort of tyranny. –<em>Edmund Burke</em></li>
 	<li>A government is not legitimate merely because it exists. –<em>Jeane J. Kirkpatrick</em></li>
 	<li>Resistance to tyranny is service to God. –<em>James Madison</em></li>
 	<li>We do many things at the federal level that would be considered dishonest and illegal if done in the private sector. –<em>Donald T. Regan</em></li>
 	<li>[During the 20th century] … 170 million men, women, and children have been shot, beaten, tortured, knifed, burned, starved, frozen, crushed, or worked to death; buried alive, drowned, hung, bombed, or killed in any other of the myriad ways governments have inflicted death on unarmed, helpless citizens and foreigners. –<em> J. Rummel, Death by Government</em></li>
 	<li>Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental opinion of a day. But a series of oppressions, begun at a distinguished period, and pursued unalterably through every change of ministers, too plainly proves a deliberate systematic plan of reducing us to slavery. –<em>Thomas Jefferson</em></li>
 	<li>This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he first appears he is a protector. –<em>Plato circa 400 B.C.</em></li>
 	<li>The ideal tyranny is that which is ignorantly self-administered by its victims. The most perfect slaves are, therefore, those which blissfully and unawaredly enslave themselves. –<em>Dresden James</em></li>
 	<li>I am unable to accept the idea that I should be an obedient subject of a gang of corrupt, unprincipled thugs who pontificate about freedom while enslaving the population. –<em>John Pugsley, JPJ Nov 96</em></li>
 	<li>By the year 2012, projected outlays for entitlements and interest on the national debt will consume all tax revenues collected by the federal government … There will not be one cent left over for education, children's programs, highways, national defense, or any other discretionary program. –<em>Bipartisan U.S. Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform</em></li>
 	<li>Christmas is a time when kids tell Santa what they want and adults pay for it. Deficits are when adults tell the government what they want and their kids pay for it. –<em>Richard Lamm, former Gov of Colorado</em></li>
 	<li>A government debt is a government claim against personal income and private property – an unpaid tax bill. –<em>Hans F. Sennholz, Debts &amp; Deficits</em></li>
 	<li>There is no art which government sooner learns of another than that of draining money from the pockets of the people. –<em>Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations</em></li>
 	<li>The principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but a swindling futurity on a large scale. –<em>Thomas Jefferson</em></li>
 	<li>I fear for our nation. Nearly half of our people receive some kind of government subsidy. We have grown weak from too much affluence and too little adversity. I fear that soon we will not be able to defend our country from our sure and certain enemies. We have debased our currency to the point that even the most loyal citizen no longer trusts it. –<em>A Roman Senator in A.D. 63</em></li>
 	<li>The Social Security system did not begin as an attempt to sabotage people's ability to plan for retirement, but it has worked out that way. The politicians who originally planned the system probably had no idea how it would turn out. But today's politicians know the system is rotted, and yet they refuse to make the changes necessary to free the American people from it. Instead, they make it worse. –<em>Ed Clark 1980 LP presidential candidate, A New Beginning</em></li>
 	<li>While the feds … leave Social Security off their books, the government's obligation to make benefit payments to current and near-term Social Security recipients is certainly no less real than its obligation to pay interest on its Treasury bonds. –<em>Laurence K. Kotlikoff, Harvard Business Review, "From Deficit Delusion to Generational Accounting", May-June, 1993</em></li>
 	<li>The one with the primary responsibility to the individual's future is that individual. –<em>Dorcas Hardy, Director, Social Security System</em></li>
 	<li>We should distinguish at this point between "government" and "state" … A government is the consensual organization by which we adjudicate disputes, defend our rights, and provide for certain common needs … A state on the other hand, is a coercive organization asserting or enjoying a monopoly over the use of physical force in some geographic area and exercising power over its subjects. –<em>David Boaz</em></li>
 	<li>Little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism, but peace, easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice. –<em>Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations</em></li>
 	<li>The thing that differentiates people from animals is money. –<em>Gertrude Stein</em></li>
 	<li>If the rich could hire other people to die for them, the poor could make a wonderful living. –<em>Yiddish proverb</em></li>
 	<li>Money, not morality, is the principle of commercial nations. –<em>Thomas Jefferson</em></li>
 	<li>It is a socialist idea that making profits is a vice; I consider the real vice is making losses. –<em>Winston Churchill</em></li>
 	<li>Anyone taken as an individual is tolerably sensible and reasonable – as a member of a crowd, he at once becomes a blockhead. –<em>Friedrich von Schiller</em></li>
 	<li>The real issue is control. The Internet is too widespread to be easily dominated by any single government. By creating a seamless global economic zone, anti-sovereign and unregulatable, the Internet calls into question the very idea of a nation-state. –<em>John Perry Barlow</em></li>
 	<li>Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin. Bankruptcies and losses concentrate the mind on prudent behavior. –<em>Allan H. Meltzer</em></li>
 	<li>You doubt that … your great country … is on the wane? I say only this – look around you. –<em>Saint Griseus</em></li>
 	<li>In the United States we have, in effect, two governments … We have the duly constituted Government … Then we have an independent, uncontrolled and uncoordinated government in the Federal Reserve System, operating the money powers which are reserved to Congress by the Constitution. –<em>Congressman Wright Patman</em></li>
 	<li>It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning. –<em>Henry Ford</em></li>
 	<li>Law! What do I care about the law? Ain't I got the power? –<em>Cornelius Vanderbilt</em></li>
 	<li>Does America really need 70 percent of the world's lawyers? … Is it healthy for our economy to have 18 million lawsuits coursing through our system annually? –<em>Dan Quayle August 13, 1991</em></li>
 	<li>Never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal. –<em>Martin Luther King Jr.</em></li>
 	<li>If one really wishes to know how justice is administered in a country, one does not question the policemen, the lawyers, the judges, or the protected members of the middle class. One goes to the unprotected – those, precisely, who need the law's protection most! – and listens to their testimony. –<em>James Baldwin, African-American Author, "No Name in the Street"</em></li>
 	<li>… the next revolution … will be when those who work refuse to support those who don't. –<em>Walter Hickel</em></li>
 	<li>The standard of living of the common man is higher in those countries which have the greatest number of wealthy entrepreneurs. –<em>Ludwig von Mises</em></li>
 	<li>There are two kinds of people – those who do the work and those who take the credit. Try to be in the first group, there is less competition there. –<em>Indira Gandhi</em></li>
 	<li>Political elections do not choose leaders of society. Rather, they are an exercise in which groups of people choose individuals who will assist them in looting other groups of individuals, those folks who were unfortunate enough not to be able to elect their own political strongman. The process can be downright blatant, as is the case in African and Asian countries, or it can be relatively subtle as it is in the United States, where the trappings of "constitutionality" and "rule of law" hide many of the more nefarious goings on. –<em>William Anderson, Are Politicians Leaders? </em><em>10/19/2000</em></li>
 	<li>Our two-party system is a fraud, a sham, a delusion. On foreign policy, trade, immigration, Big Government, we have one-party government, one party press; and conservatives are being played for suckers. –<em>Patrick J Buchanan</em></li>
 	<li>Political satire became obsolete when Henry Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. –<em>Tom Lehrer</em></li>
 	<li>Powerful government tends to draw into it people with bloated egos, people who think they know more than everyone else and have little hesitance in coercing their fellow man. Or as Nobel Laureate Friedrich Hayek said, "in government, the scum rises to the top". –<em>Walter E. Williams</em></li>
 	<li>Being elected to Congress is regarded as being sent on a looting raid for one's friends. –<em>George F. Will, Newsweek</em></li>
 	<li>Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies. –<em>Groucho Marx</em></li>
 	<li>Men rise from one ambition to another – first they seek to secure themselves from attack, and then they attack others. –<em>Machiavelli</em></li>
 	<li>This country has come to feel the same when Congress is in session as we do when the baby gets hold of a hammer. –<em>Will Rogers</em></li>
 	<li>Wherever politics intrudes upon economic life, political success is readily attained by saying what people like to hear rather than what is demonstrably true. Instead of safeguarding truth and honesty, the state then tends to become a major source of insincerity and mendacity. –<em>Hans F. Sennholz</em></li>
 	<li>Those who make peaceful change impossible will make violent revolution inevitable. –<em>John F. Kennedy</em></li>
 	<li>80 percent were hypocrites, 80 percent liars, 80 percent serious sinners … except of Sundays. There is always boozing and floozing … I don't have enough time to tell you everybody's name. –<em>William Miller, Congressional doorkeeper</em></li>
 	<li>Politicians are always interested in people. Not that this is always a virtue. Fleas are interested in dogs. –<em>J. O'Rourke</em></li>
 	<li>A concern for states rights, local self government and regional identity used to be taken for granted everywhere in America. But the United States is no longer, as it once was, a federal union of diverse states and regions. National uniformity is being imposed by the political class that runs Washington, the economic class that owns Wall Street and the cultural class in charge of Hollywood and the Ivy League. –<em>Michael Hill, professor of British History, University of Alabama</em></li>
 	<li>Nothing is so admirable in politics as a short memory. –<em>John Kenneth Galbraith</em></li>
 	<li>Since a politician never believes what he says, he is surprised when others believe him. –<em>Charles DeGaulle</em></li>
 	<li>Politics I supposed to be the second-oldest profession. I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first. –<em>Ronald Reagan</em></li>
 	<li>Men who have greatness within them don't go in for politics. –<em>Albert Camus</em></li>
 	<li>It may be true … that "you can't fool all the people all the time", but you can fool enough of them to rule a large country. –<em>Will &amp; Ariel Durant</em></li>
 	<li>Suppose you were an idiot and suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself. –<em>Mark Twain</em></li>
 	<li>Politicians can't give us anything without depriving us of something else. Government is not a god. Every dime they spend must first be taken from someone else. –<em>Gary Asmus</em></li>
 	<li>Laws are like sausages. You sleep far better the less you know about how they are made. –<em>Otto Von Bismark</em></li>
 	<li>Our democracy is but a name. We vote? What does that mean? It means that we choose between two bodies of real, though not avowed, autocrats. We choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. –<em>Helen Keller</em></li>
 	<li>Democracies have been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and in general have been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their death. –<em>James Madison</em></li>
 	<li>Citizen participation [is] a device whereby public officials induce nonpublic individuals to act in a way the officials desire. –<em>Daniel P. Moynihan</em></li>
 	<li>If I deny the authority of the State when it presents my tax bill, it will soon take and waste all my property, and so harass me and my children without end. This is hard, this makes it impossible for a man to live honestly, and at the same time comfortably, in outward respects. –<em>Henry David Thoreau</em></li>
 	<li>Voters who live off taxpayers are the Democrats' ace in the hole. The Democrats created big programs and never let the recipients forget it. This gives them an initial advantage of tens of millions of votes in any presidential election. –<em>Joseph Sobran</em></li>
 	<li>The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not. –<em>Thomas Jefferson</em></li>
 	<li>Multiple political parties are a fact of life throughout Europe and most of the West. Today the only countries without strong multiparty political systems are the United States and a number of third world military dictatorships. –<em>Thomas H. Naylor</em></li>
 	<li>Vote for the man who promises least; he'll be the least disappointing. –<em>Bernard Baruch</em></li>
 	<li>It is indeed a singular thing that people wish to pass laws to nullify the disagreeable consequences that the law of responsibility entails. Will they never realize that they do not eliminate these consequences but merely pass them along to other people? The result is one injustice the more and one moral the less. –<em>Frederic Bastiat</em></li>
 	<li>Students now arrive at the university ignorant and cynical about our political heritage, lacking the wherewithal to be either inspired by it or seriously critical of it. –<em>Allan Bloom, The Closing of the American Mind</em></li>
 	<li>The voice of the majority is no proof of justice. –<em>Johann von Schiller</em></li>
 	<li>It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood, if they be repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is today, can guess what it will be like tomorrow. –<em>James Madison, Federalist Paper #62</em></li>
 	<li>A great many laws in a country, like many physicians, is a sign of malady. –<em>Voltaire</em></li>
 	<li>An individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law. –<em>Martin Luther King Jr.</em></li>
 	<li>Unnecessary laws are not good laws, but traps for money. –<em>Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, 1651</em></li>
 	<li>The rule of law can be wiped out in one misguided, however well-intentioned, generation. –<em>William T. Gossett, President ABA</em></li>
 	<li>Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes. –<em>Benjamin Franklin</em></li>
 	<li>The government's only proper job is to protect individual rights against violence by force or fraud … to protect men from foreign invaders … to settle disputes among men according to objective laws … The greatness of the Founding Fathers was how well they understood this issue and how close some of them came to understanding it perfectly. –<em>Ayn Rand</em></li>
 	<li>The Constitution is not hearsay. It is not a bunch of legal myths passed along by word of mouth. It is not a depository for judicial delusions and ideological pipe dreams. It is not a figment of some justice's Marxian imagination. It is a written document – a legally binding contract whose words, spirit and intent are clear. –<em>Linda Bowles, nationally syndicated columnist</em></li>
 	<li>The ultimate touchstone of constitutionality is the Constitution itself and not what we have said about it. –<em>Felix Frankfurter, Graves vs. New York; 1939</em></li>
 	<li>We the people are the rightful master of both congress and the courts – not to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution. –<em>Abraham Lincoln</em></li>
 	<li>Terrorism is a direct response to the crimes our government has committed against foreigners (besides which, the actual terrorists are within our own government) –<em>Gore Vidal</em></li>
 	<li>If [drugs] didn't exist, our government would have to invent them, the better to enact laws aimed at keeping the citizens "sinless and obedient." –<em>Gore Vidal</em></li>
 	<li>Going to war accelerated the move from indirect to direct rule. Almost any state that makes war finds that it cannot pay for the effort from its accumulated reserves and current revenues. Almost all war-making states borrow extensively, raise taxes, and seize the means of combat – including men – from reluctant citizens who have other uses for their resources. –<em>Charles Tilly</em></li>
 	<li>When the tyrant has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty, and there is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some war or other, in order that the people may require a leader. –<em>Plato, 347 B.C.</em></li>
 	<li>Governments need armies to protect them from their enslaved and oppressed subjects. –<em>Tolstoy</em></li>
 	<li>I say one evil empire down … one to go. –<em>Michael Moore, The Big One</em></li>
 	<li>The laws of economics tell us that the expansion of the central state can't go on forever. Its limit is reached when the looted turn on the looters. And that's beginning to happen. More than six decades of hard work for American liberty beginning with the Old Right opposition to the Roosevelt Revolution and continuing with the Mises Institute, is beginning to bear fruit. –<em>Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr. 11-27-96</em></li>
 	<li>The leviathan state, that monster devouring civilization in this century, is in the throes of death. This is not a wish or a prediction, but a conclusion drawn from a broad look at the trends of the last decade and a half, which, if we take the right steps, can continue on into the next century. What has happened around the world – nations states collapsing, markets outwitting planners, citizens rising up against government masters – can and is happening here at home. –<em>Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.</em></li>
 	<li>In order to become the master, the politician poses as the servant. –<em>Charles de Gaulle</em></li>
 	<li>No state, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get out of the Union. Plainly, the central idea of secession, is the essence of anarchy. [!] –<em>Abraham Lincoln</em></li>
 	<li>We protest solemnly in the face of mankind, that we desire peace at any sacrifice, save that of honor. In independence we seek no conquest, no aggrandizement, no concession of any kind from the states with which we have lately been confederated. All we ask is to be let alone – that those who never held power over us shall not now attempt our subjugation by arms. This we will, we must resist to the direst extremity. The moment that this pretension is abandoned, the sword will drop from our grasp, and we shall be ready to enter into treaties of amnesty and commerce that cannot but be mutually beneficial. So long as this pretension is maintained, with a firm reliance on that Divine Power which covers with its protection the just cause, we must continue to struggle for our inherent right to freedom, independence, and self government. –<em>President Jefferson Davis' first address to the Confederate Congress</em></li>
 	<li>In our government-controlled schools we are taught that Lincoln was our greatest president because his war ended slavery and saved the Union. As usual, the other side of the story – the side that reflects poorly on the government – somehow gets lost. –<em>Richard J. Maybury, The Abe Lincoln Hoax</em></li>
 	<li>So the case stands, and under all the passion of the parties and the cries of battle lie the two chief moving causes of the struggle. Union means so many millions a year lost to the South; secession means the loss of the same millions to the North. The love of money is the root of this as of many many other evils … the quarrel between North and South is, as it stands, solely a fiscal quarrel. –<em>Charles Dickens, as editor of All the Year Round, a British periodical in 1862</em></li>
 	<li>Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them better. This is a most valuable, a most sacred right – a right which we hope and believe is to liberate the world. Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing government may choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people, that can, may revolutionize, and make their own of so much of the territory as they inhabit. –<em>Abraham Lincoln [!], January 12, 1848 speech in Congress</em></li>
 	<li>Federalism is not when the central government graciously allows the states to do this or that. That is just another form of administration. True federalism is when the people of the states set limits to the central government. Fundamentally, federalism means states rights. The cause of states rights is the cause of liberty. They rise or fall together. –<em>Clyde C. Wilson</em></li>
 	<li>For 134 years the American people have been led to believe that the right of secession had been overturned by a "verdict of arms," but that isn't true … It is true the shot fired at Fort Sumter was a mistake since it provided the pretext for the Southland to be invaded by foreign troops, but the right of secession realized through the ballot box remains an essential part of our constitutional order. –<em>George Kalas, Chairman Emeritus, The Southern Party</em></li>
 	<li>The American people, North and South, went into the [Civil] war as citizens of their respective states, they came out as subjects … what they thus lost they have never got back. –<em>L. Mencken</em></li>
 	<li>The future inhabitants of [both] the Atlantic and Mississippi states will be our sons. We think we see their happiness in their union, and we wish it. Events may prove otherwise; and if they see their interest in separating why should we take sides? God bless them both, and keep them in union if it be for their good, but separate them if it be better. –<em>Thomas Jefferson</em></li>
 	<li>I expect to see trade wars, foreign policy disasters, a few race riots, a decrease in personal liberty, higher taxes, higher inflation and probably, economic collapse. The silver lining is, secession will probably become more feasible. –<em>Charley Reese, What the next four years has in store for us column Nov. 8.1996 in Orlando Sentinal</em></li>
 	<li>Up until the late unpleasantness of the Civil war, then, the right of secession was more or less taken for granted in many quarters, and there has never been any amendment or even a Supreme Court decision saying it's improper. –<em>Samual Francis, Secession May Be Legal But Not Expedient, Conservative Chronicles</em></li>
 	<li>If there be any among us who wish to dissolve the Union or to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed, as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it. –<em>Thomas Jefferson's First Inaugural Address</em></li>
 	<li>The Union was formed by the voluntary agreement of the States; and these, in uniting together, have not forfeited their Nationality, nor have they been reduced to the condition of one and the same people. If one of the States chose to withdraw its name from the contract, it would be difficult to disprove its right of doing so … –<em>Alex de Tocqueville, Democracy In America</em></li>
 	<li>If [the Declaration of Independence] justifies the secession from the British empire of 3,000,000 of colonists in 1776, we do not see why it would not justify the secession of 5,000,000 of Southrons from the Federal Union in 1861. –<em>New York Tribune, December 17, 1860</em></li>
 	<li>The United States has become too big, too authoritarian, and too undemocratic. Its states assume too little responsibility for the solution of their own social, economic, and political problems. So starved for revenue are our states that they are all too willing to abdicate to the federal government their responsibilities for public education, criminal justice, employment, and environmental protection. Fine tuning or patch our badly crippled political system will do little to turn the situation around. There is only one solution to the problems of America – peaceful dissolution, not piecemeal devolution. –<em>Thomas H. Naylor &amp; William H. Willimon, Downsizing the U.S.A.</em></li>
 	<li>The error is in the assumption that the General Government is a party to the constitutional compact. The States … formed the compact, acting as sovereign and independent communities. –<em>John C. Calhoun</em></li>
 	<li>The procedure of secession was to have an election for delegates to a state convention, to meet in convention, and to adopt ordinances of secession. This was done in accord with the Southern understanding of what would be in keeping with the United States Constitution. It had, after all, been ratified by the states acting through conventions. Could they not "un-ratify"it – secede from the Union – in the same fashion? –<em>Clarence Carson, A Basic History Of The United States</em></li>
 	<li>Our government is an agency of delegated and strictly limited powers. Its founders did not look to its preservation by force; but the chain they wove to bind these States together was one of love and mutual good offices … –<em>Jefferson Davis</em></li>
 	<li>If you would not confront your neighbor and demand his money at the point of a gun to solve every new problem that may appear in your life, you should not allow the government to do it for you. –<em>William E. Simon</em></li>
 	<li>A democracy is a place where numerous elections are held, at great cost, without issues, and with interchangeable candidates. –<em>Gore Vidal</em></li>
 	<li>Taxation <em>with</em>representation ain't so hot either. –<em> Gerald Barzan</em></li>
 	<li>Fifty-one percent of a nation can establish a totalitarian regime, suppress minorities and still remain democratic. –<em>Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn</em></li>

 	<li>The difference between death and taxes is, death doesn't get worse every time Congress meets. – <em>Will Rogers</em></li>
 	<li>The Constitution is a limitation on the government, not on private individuals. It does not prescribe the conduct of private individuals, only the conduct of the government.

I would ask you to try to argue that this statement says that only pepperoni pizzas can keep and cook tomatoes, and only well-crafted ones at that. This is basically what the so-called states rights people argue with respect to the well-regulated militia, vs. the right to keep and bear arms. –<em> Bruce Tiemann</em>

 	<li>The New Deal Court essentially told Congress: It doesn't matter what the Constitution says or what limits on government it establishes, you are empowered to spend money on whatever you please. And so Congress does, even though its profligacy has placed the nation in great economic peril. –<em>Stephen Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, March, 1997</em></li>

 	<li>A society that puts equality … ahead of freedom will end up with neither equality nor freedom. – <em>Milton Friedman</em></li>
 	<li>Government is about coercion. Limiting government is the single most important instrument for guaranteeing liberty. We're working on a third generation which has little in the way of education about what our Constitution means and why it was written. Thus, we've fallen easy prey to charlatens, quacks, and hustlers. – <em> Walter Williams</em></li>

 	<li>The illegal drug trade is the financial engine that fuels many terrorist organizations around the world, including Osama bin Laden. – <em>Dennis Hastert, House Speaker</em></li>
 	<li>It is the fundamental theory of all the more recent American law … that the average citizen is half-witted, and hence not to be trusted to either his own devices or his own thoughts. – <em> L. Mencken</em></li>
 	<li>Most people want security in this world, not liberty. – <em>L. Mencken (1880-1956)</em></li>
 	<li>For the average American, freedom of speech is simply the freedom to repeat what everyone else is saying and no more. – <em>Gore Vidal</em></li>
 	<li>Contrary to popular opinion, the Constitution was not – and is not – a grant of rights to the citizenry. Instead, the Constitution is a "barbed-wire entanglement" designed to interfere with, restrict, and impede government officials in the exercise of political power. – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140822072329/http:/www.fff.org/comment/ed1101h.asp"><em>Jacob Hornberger, 11/01</em></a></li>
 	<li>When freedom prevails, the ingenuity and inventiveness of people creates incredible wealth. This is the source of the natural improvement of the human condition. – <em>Brian S. Wesbury</em></li>
 	<li>To make laws that man cannot, and will not obey, serves to bring all law into contempt. – <em>Elizabeth Cady Stanton</em></li>
 	<li>To be governed … is to be watched, inspected, directed, indoctrinated, numbered, estimated, regulated, commanded, controlled, law-driven, preached at, spied upon, censured, checked, valued, enrolled – by creatures who have neither the right, nor the wisdom, nor the virtue to do so. – <em>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</em></li>
 	<li>There seems to be an attitude that government ownership of land is good as long as you call it "open space" … All it is is socialism. – <em>Douglas Bruce, Colorado tax-reduction activist</em></li>
 	<li>Statism survives by looting; a free country survives by production. – <em>Ayn Rand</em></li>
 	<li>The "private sector" of the economy is, in fact, the <em>voluntary</em>sector; and...the "public sector" is, in fact, the <em>coercive</em> – <em>Henry Hazlitt</em></li>
 	<li>Americans have the mistaken viewpoint that Lady Liberty is only a peacetime luxury who is ill-equipped to fight the nasties. Therefore, they reason, we need an equally nasty Big Brother. Americans have forgotten that Lady Liberty is one ferocious mother when protecting her children. – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140822072329/http:/www.lp.org/lpnews/0112/ruwart.html"><em>Mary Ruwart</em></a></li>
 	<li>Try to halt violence by restricting gun ownership and you won't halt violence. But you will create entire classes of new criminals – people who make paperwork errors, violate technical specification of the law, or rebel against the new restrictions. And you'll create new bureaus, new enforcement arms, new prisons to punish them. You'll make hordes of lawyers and bureaucrats very happy. Organized criminals will be grateful to the naive moral crusaders ("useful idiots") as they profit by selling an illegal product. And ordinary street criminals will bless fools, legislators, and "leaders" for making their job so much safer. – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140822072329/http:/www.jpfo.org/"><em>JPFO's</em></a><em>"Bill of RIghts Sentinel", Fall 2001.</em></li>
 	<li>What is the basic, the essential, the crucial principle that differentiates freedom from slavery? It is the principle of voluntary action versus physical coercion or compulsion. – <em>Ayn Rand</em></li>
 	<li>For libertarians, freedom entails the right of people to live their lives any way they choose, so long as their conduct is peaceful. For conservatives, freedom entails the right of government to do just about anything it wants, even if its conduct is violent. – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140822072329/http:/www.free-market.net/rd/275294030.html"><em>Jacob Hornberger</em></a></li>
 	<li>A caged canary is safe but not free. – <em>Walter Williams</em></li>
 	<li>The prospect of a government that treats all its citizens as criminal suspects is more terrifying than any terrorist. And even more frightening is a citizenry that can accept the surrender of its freedoms as the price of "freedom". – <em>Joe Sobran</em></li>
 	<li>There is nothing so bad that politics cannot make it worse. – <em>Thomas Sowell</em></li>
 	<li>Politicians, like diapers, have to be changed frequently – and for the very same reason. – <em>Anonymous</em></li>
 	<li>The reason welfare is bad is not because it costs too much, nor because it "undermines the work ethic," but because it is intrinsically at odds with the way human beings come to live satisfying lives. –<em>Charles Murray</em></li>
 	<li>Public Schools too often fail because they are shielded from the very force that improves performance and sparks innovation in nearly every other human enterprise – competition. – <em>Robert Lutz/Clark Durant</em></li>
 	<li>He who regulates everything by laws, is more likely to arouse vices than reform them. – <em>Spinoza</em></li>
 	<li>The welfare state is the oldest con game in the world. First you take people's money away quietly, and then you give some of it back to them flamboyantly. – <em>Thomas Sowell</em></li>
 	<li>If politicians were serious about day care for children, instead of just sloganizing about it, nothing they could do would improve the quality of child care more than by lifting the heavy burden of taxation that forces so many families to have both parents working. – <em>Thomas Sowell</em></li>
 	<li>The natural effort of every individual to better his own condition is so powerful that it is alone, and without any assistance, capable not only of carrying on the society to wealth and prosperity, but of surmounting 100 impertinent obstructions with which the folly of human laws too often encumbers its operations. – <em>Adam Smith</em></li>
 	<li>Education – compulsory schooling, compulsory learning – is a tyranny and a crime against the human mind and spirit. Let all those escape it who can, any way they can. – <em>John Holt</em></li>
 	<li>The economic miracle that has been the United States was not produced by socialized enterprises, by government-unon-industry cartels or by centralized economic planning. It was produced by private enterprises in a profit-and-loss system. And losses were at least as important in weeding out failures, as profits in fostering successes. Let government succor failures, and we shall be headed for stagnation and decline. – <em>Milton Friedman</em></li>
 	<li>The public school system: "Usually a twelve year sentence of mind control. Crushing creativity, smashing individualism, encouraging collectivism and compromise, destroying the exercise of intellectual inquiry, twisting it instead into meek subservience to authority." – <em>Walter Karp, Editor Harper's Magazine</em></li>
 	<li>The ground of liberty is to be gained by inches, and we must be contented to secure what we can get from time to time and eternally press forward for what is yet to get. It takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good. – <em>Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826 3rd US President &amp; Founding Father)</em></li>
 	<li>"Democracy – A government of the masses. Authority derived through mass meeting or any form of direct expression. Results in mobocracy. Attitude toward property is communistic – negating property rights. Attitude toward law is that the will of the majority shall regulate, whether it is based upon deliberation or governed by passion, prejudice, and impulse, without restraint or regard for consequences. Results in demagogism, license, agitation, discontent, anarchy." – <em>1928 U.S. Army Training Manual</em></li>
 	<li>… so long as the people do not care to exercise their freedom, those who wish to tyrannize will do so; for tyrants are active and ardent, and will devote themselves in the name of any number of gods, religious and otherwise, to put shackles upon sleeping men. – <em>Voltairine de Cleyre</em></li>
 	<li>Arms are the only true badge of liberty. The possession of arms is the distinction of a free man from a slave. – <em>Andrew Fletcher 1698</em></li>
 	<li>Economic freedom is an essential requisite for political freedom. By enabling people to cooperate with one another without coercion or central direction, it reduces the area over which political power is exercised. – <em>Milton Friedman</em></li>
 	<li>Whenever we depart from voluntary cooperation and try to do good by using force, the bad moral value of force triumphs over good intentions. – <em>Milton Friedman</em></li>
 	<li>The elementary truth is that the Great Depression was produced by government mismanagement [of money]. It was not produced by the failure of private enterprise. – <em>Milton Friedman</em></li>
 	<li>The essential notion of a capitalist society … is voluntary cooperation, voluntary exchange. The essential notion of a socialist society is force. – <em>Milton Friedman</em></li>
 	<li>Consider Social Security. The young have always contributed to the support of the old. Earlier, the young helped their own parents out of a sense of love and duty. They now contribute to the support of someone else's parents out of compulsion and fear. The voluntary transfers strengthened the bonds of the family; the compulsory transfers weaken those bonds. – <em>Milton Friedman</em></li>
 	<li>The American people are becoming more and more afraid of, and are running away from, their own revolution. – <em>Leonard E. Read</em></li>
 	<li>The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it. – <em>John Stuart Mill</em></li>
 	<li>I shall exert every faculty I possess in aiding to prevent the Constitution from being nullified, destroyed, or impaired; and even though I should see it fail, I will still, with a voice feeble, perhaps, but earnest as ever issued from human lips, and with extinguish, call on the people to come to its rescue. – <em>Daniel Webster</em></li>
 	<li>The liberties of our country, the freedom of our civil constitution, are worth defending at all hazards; and it is our duty to defend them against all attacks … It will bring an everlasting mark of infamy on the present generation, enlightened as it is, if we should suffer them to be wrested from us by violence without a struggle, or be cheated out of them by the artifices of false and designing men. – <em>Samuel Adams</em></li>
 	<li>The fact throughout history is that whenever government dominates the economic affairs of its citizenry, a free society is eroded, then destroyed, and a minority government ensues. Personal liberty without economic liberty is an absolute contradiction; the one cannot exist without the other. – <em>William E. Simon</em></li>
 	<li>Freedom is not a luxury for a few wealthy nations; as many of our liberal pundits try to tell us, but a necessity for the poor and hungry. – <em>Edward P. Coleson</em></li>
 	<li>Were it necessary to bring a majority into a comprehension of the libertarian philosophy, the cause of liberty would be utterly hopeless. Every significant movement in history has been led by one or just a few individuals with a small minority of energetic supporters. – <em>Leonard E. Read</em></li>
 	<li>Man must have the right of choice, even to choose wrong, if he shall ever learn to choose right. – <em>Josiah C. Wedgwood</em></li>
 	<li>Central planning will eventually destroy individual liberty by concentrating all political power in one person or in a committee; furthermore, it will eventually end our prosperity by laying the dead hand of state control on the economy. – <em>Robert M. Thornton</em></li>
 	<li>The greatest threat to the future of our nation – to our freedom – is not foreign military aggression … but the growing dependence of the people on a paternalistic government. A nation is no stronger than its people and the best measure of their strength is how they accept responsibility. There will never be a great society unless the materialism of the welfare state is replaced by individual initiative and responsibility. – <em>Charles B. Shuman</em></li>
 	<li>The king has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent Swarms of Officers to harass our People and eat out their substance. – <em>S. Declaration of Independence</em></li>
 	<li>Few of us seem to want to keep government out of our personal affairs and responsibilities. Many of us seem to favor various types of government guaranteed and compulsory "security." We say that we want personal freedom, but we demand government housing, government price controls, government-guaranteed jobs and wages. We boast that we are responsible persons, but we vote for candidates who promise us special privileges, government pensions, government subsidies, and government electricity. – <em>Dean Russell</em></li>
 	<li>The beneficial effect of state intervention, especially in the form of legislation, is direct, immediate, and so to speak, visible, while its evil effects are gradual and indirect and lay out of sight … Hence the majority of mankind must almost of necessity look with undue favor upon governmental intervention. – <em> V. Dicey</em></li>
 	<li>The right most valued by all civilized men is the right to be left alone. – <em>Justice Louis Brandeis</em></li>
 	<li>It must be obvious that liberty necessarily means freedom to choose foolishly as well as wisely; freedom to choose evil as well as good; freedom to enjoy the rewards of good judgment, and freedom to suffer the penalties of bad judgment. If this is not true, the word "freedom" has no meaning. – <em>Ben Moreell</em></li>
 	<li>There is nothing new in state interventionism. It is as old and reactionary as societal organization itself. Always, when it permeates the body politic, it kills the nation. – <em>Spruille Braden</em></li>
 	<li>Throughout forty centuries of human experience, price controls at their best have always been a miserable failure. At their worst, they have led to famine and bloodshed – to defeat and to disaster. –<em>Irving S. Olds</em></li>
 	<li>Somehow, the fact that more poor people are on welfare, receiving more generous payments, does not seem to have made this country a nice place to live – not even for the poor on welfare, whose condition seems not noticeably better than when they were poor and off welfare. Something appears to have gone wrong; a liberal and compassionate social policy has bred all sorts of unanticipated and perverse consequences. – <em>Irving Kristol</em></li>
 	<li>Given man's nature, freedom will always be in jeopardy, and the only question that need concern each of us is if and how well we took our stand in its defense during the short period of time when we were potentially a part of the struggle. – <em>Benjamin Rogge</em></li>
 	<li>It seems that wherever the Welfare State is involved, the moral precept, "Thou shalt not steal," becomes altered to say: "Thou shalt not steal, except for what thou deemest to be a worthy cause, where thou thinkest that thou canst use the loot for a better purpose than wouldst the victim of the theft." – <em> A. Harper</em></li>
 	<li>We must remember that the principal instrument of government is coercion and that our government officials are no more moral, omnipotent, nor omniscient than are any of the rest of us. Once we understand the basic principles which must be observed if freedom is to be safeguarded against government, we may become more hesitant in turning our personal problems and responsibilities over to that agency of coercion, with its insatiable appetite for power. – <em> C. Mullendore</em></li>
 	<li>Of all the enemies to public liberty, war is perhaps the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes; and armies, debts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few … No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare. – <em>James Madison</em></li>
 	<li>Property is the fruit of labor. Property is desirable, is a positive good in the world. That some should be rich shows that others may become rich and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprise. Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another, but let him work diligently to build one for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence. –<em>Abraham Lincoln</em></li>
 	<li>The essential quality of a free economy is that it cannot be planned. It leaves the solution of problems to the inspiration of the individuals in the untrammeled population. When something approaching a free economy has existed, it has always worked better than the schemes of any planners. – <em>Thomas H. Barber</em></li>
 	<li>See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime. Then abolish this law without delay, for it is not only an evil itself, but also it is a fertile source for further evils because it invites reprisals. –<em>Frédéric Bastiat</em></li>
 	<li>The proliferation of bureaucrats and its invariable accompaniment, much heavier tax levies on the productive part of the population, are the recognizable signs, not of a great, but of a decaying society. Historians know that both phenomena were especially marked in the declining eras of the Roman Empire in the West and of its successor state, the Eastern or Byzantine Empire. – <em>William Henry Chamberlin</em></li>
 	<li>Government-to-government foreign aid promotes statism, centralized planning, socialism, dependence, pauperization, inefficiency, and waste. It prolongs the poverty it is designed to cure. Voluntary private investment in private enterprise, on the other hand, promotes capitalism, production, independence, and self-reliance. – <em>Henry Hazlit</em></li>
 	<li>Do not consider Collectivists as "sincere but deluded idealists". The proposal to enslave some men for the sake of others is not an ideal; brutality is not "idealistic," no matter what its purpose. Do not ever say that the desire to "do good" by force is a good motive. Neither power-lust nor stupidity are good motives. – <em>Ayn Rand</em></li>
 	<li>Government ought to be as much open to improvement as anything which appertains to man, instead of which it has been monopolized from age to age, by the most ignorant and vicious of the human race. Need we any other proof of their wretched management, than the excess of debts and taxes with which every nation groans, and the quarrels into which they have precipitated the world?" –<em>Thomas Paine</em></li>
 	<li>Painful as it may be to hear it, there's nothing special about the people of this country that sets them apart from the other people of the world. It is the Bill of Rights, and only the Bill of Rights, that keeps us from becoming the world's biggest banana republic. The moment we forget that, the American Dream is over. – <em>Alexander Hope, "Looking Forward"</em></li>
 	<li>Most of the major ills of the world have been caused by well-meaning people who ignored the principle of individual freedom, except as applied to themselves, and who were obsessed with fanatical zeal to improve the lot of mankind-in-the-mass through some pet formula of their own. – <em>Henry Grady Weaver, author of a classic book on freedom,</em>The Mainspring of Human Progress</li>
 	<li>The greatest productive force is human selfishness. – <em>Robert Heinlein</em></li>
 	<li>I do not challenge the dedication and sincerity of those who disagree with the freedom philosophy and confidently promote government solutions for all our ills. I am just absolutely convinced that the best formula for giving us peace and preserving the American way of life is freedom, limited government, and minding our own business overseas. – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140822072329/http:/www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2001/cr112901.htm"><em>Ron Paul</em></a></li>
 	<li>If an exchange between two parties is voluntary, it will not take place unless both believe they will benefit from it. Most economic fallacies derive from the neglect of this simple insight, from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie, that one party can gain only at the expense of another. – <em>Milton Friedman</em></li>
 	<li>If you don't risk anything, you risk even more. – <em>Erica Jong</em></li>
 	<li>The harm done by ordinary criminals, murderers, gangsters, and thieves is negligible in comparison with the agony inflicted upon human beings by the professional do-gooders, who attempt to set themselves up as gods on earth and who would ruthlessly force their views on all others – with the abiding assurance that the end justifies the means. – <em>Henry Grady Weaver, author of a classic book on freedom,</em>The Mainspring of Human Progress</li>
 	<li>Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first. – <em>Mark Twain</em></li>
 	<li>There is no limit to the ingenuity of man if it is properly and vigorously applied under conditions of peace and justice. – <em>Winston Churchill</em></li>
 	<li>Self-sacrifice enables us to sacrifice other people without blushing. – <em>George Bernard Shaw</em></li>
 	<li>Don't ask the barber whether you need a haircut. – <em>Daniel Greenberg</em></li>
 	<li>You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer. You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves. – <em>John Henry Boetker</em></li>
 	<li>There is only one success - To be able to spend your life in your own way. – <em>Christopher Morley</em></li>
 	<li>If the only motive was to help people who could not afford education, advocates of government involvement would have simply proposed tuition subsidies. – <em>Milton Friedman - Economist. </em><em>Awarded 1976 Nobel Prize in economics.</em></li>
 	<li>They told me if I voted for Goldwater, he would get us into a war in Vietnam. Well, I voted for Goldwater and that's what happened. – <em>William F. Buckley, Jr. </em><em>(founder of National Review)</em></li>
 	<li>A traffic jam is a collision between free enterprise and socialism. Free enterprise produces automobiles faster than socialism can build roads and road capacity. – <em>Andrew Galambos</em></li>
 	<li>"Let me tell you how it will be. There's one for you, nineteen for me. 'Cause I'm the taxman." – <em>George Harrison, (From song "Taxman" on The Beatles album Revolver 1966)</em></li>
 	<li>The whole gospel of Karl Marx can be summed up in a single sentence: Hate the man who is better off than you are. Never under any circumstances admit that his success may be due to his own efforts, to the productive contribution he has made to the whole community. Always attribute his success to the exploitation, the cheating, the more or less open robbery of others. Never under any circumstances admit that your own failure may be owing to your own weakness, or that the failure of anyone else may be due to his own defects – his laziness, incompetence, improvidence, or stupidity. – <em>Henry Hazlitt</em></li>
 	<li>Libertarians believe the answer to America's political problems is the same commitment to freedom that earned America its greatness: a free-market economy and the abundance and prosperity it brings; a dedication to civil liberties and personal freedom that marks this country above all others; and a foreign policy of non-intervention, peace, and free trade as prescribed by America's founders. – <em>The Libertarian Party: A Short History, 2000</em></li>
 	<li>We're told cars are wasteful. Wasteful of what? Oil did a lot of good sitting in the ground for millions of years. We're told cars should be replaced with mass transportation. But it's hard to reach the drive through window at McDonald's from a speeding train. And we're told cars cause pollution. A hundred years ago city streets were ankle deep in horse excrement. What kind of pollution do you want? Would you rather die of cancer at eighty or typhoid fever at nine? – <em>J. O'Rourke</em></li>
 	<li>When politics are used to allocate resources, the resources all end up being allocated to politics." – <em>J. O'Rourke</em></li>
 	<li>This country was founded by religious nuts with guns. – <em>J. O'Rourke</em></li>
 	<li>When one gets in bed with government, one must expect the diseases it spreads. – <em>Ron Paul, M.D., Republican congressman from Texas and Libertarian Party candidate for President in 1988</em></li>
 	<li>Have you ever noticed how statists are constantly "reforming" their own handiwork? Education reform. Health-care reform. Welfare reform. Tax reform. The very fact that they're always busy "reforming" is an implicit admission that they didn't get it right the first 50 times. – <em>Lawrence W. Reed, economist, in The Freeman</em></li>
 	<li>Those (who) seek to establish systems of Government based on the regimentation of all Human Beings by a handful of individual rulers...call this a new order. It is not new and it is not order." –<em>Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of The United States</em></li>
 	<li>Liberals love to say things like, "We're just asking everyone to pay their fair share." But government is not about asking. It is about telling. The difference is fundamental. It is the difference between making love and being raped, between working for a living and being a slave. The Internal Revenue service is not asking anybody to do anything. It confiscates your assets and puts you behind bars if you don't pay. – <em>Thomas Sowell, Forbes, July 1994</em></li>
 	<li>Man, no doubt, owes many other moral duties to his fellow men; such as to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, shelter the homeless, care for the sick, protect the defenseless, assist the weak, and enlighten the ignorant. But these are simply moral duties, of which each man must be his own judge, in each particular case, as to whether, and how, and how far, he can, or will perform them. –<em>Lysander Spooner</em></li>
 	<li>The worst evils which mankind has ever had to endure were inflicted by bad governments. The state can be and has often been in the course of history the main source of mischief and disaster. – <em>Ludwig von Mises</em></li>
 	<li>Economic history is a long record of government policies that failed because they were designed with a bold disregard for the laws of economics. – <em>Ludwig von Mises</em></li>
 	<li>Who the hell is FICA and who said he could have any of my paycheck! – <em>From the movie </em>Ferris Buehler's Day Off</li>
 	<li>Dependence leads to subservience. – <em>Thomas Jefferson</em></li>
 	<li>Libertarians have quietly become America's best organized and most significant third party. Unlike flash-in-the-pan parties organized around cults of personality like Ross Perot's and Ralph Nader's, Libertarians have organized at the grass roots for the long haul. They are fast approaching the point where they may force the major parties to reckon with Libertarian ideas. – <em>Bob Ewegen, The Denver Post, 11/24/01</em></li>
 	<li>When democratic governments create economic calamity, free markets get the blame. – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140822072329/http:/www.free-market.net/rd/119851947.html">Jack Kemp</a></li>
 	<li>When angry, count ten before you speak; if very angry, a hundred. – <em>Thomas Jefferson</em></li>
 	<li>I can think of few plainer, more direct abridgments of the freedoms of the First Amendment than to compel persons to support candidates, parties, ideologies or causes that they are against. – <em>Justice Black Lathrop v. Donohue, 367 U.S. 820, 873 (1961) (Black, J. dissenting).</em></li>
 	<li>The worst crime against working people is a company which fails to operate at a profit. – <em>Samuel Gompers</em></li>
 	<li>Concentrated political power is the most dangerous thing on earth. – <em>Rudolph Rummel</em></li>
 	<li>When liberty is taken away by force it can be restored by force. When it is relinquished voluntarily by default it can never be recovered. – <em>Dorothy Thompson, newspaper columnist</em></li>
 	<li>What pays under capitalism is satisfying the common man, the customer. The more people you satisfy, the better for you. – <em>Ludwig von Mises</em></li>
 	<li>According to the Tax Foundation, taxes now consume more than 38% of the average family's budget. That is more than is spent on food, clothing, housing, and transportation combined. Compare this to the plight of medieval serfs. They only had to give the lord of the manor one-third of their output -- and they were considered slaves. So what does that make us? – <em>Daniel Mitchell, The Washington Times, 3/9/99</em></li>
 	<li>The same government that brought you urban renewal is likely to make an even worse mess of suburban renewal. – <em>Steven Hayward, The National Review, 3/22/99</em></li>
 	<li>Our government, taxes, and ideas of freedom are already duplicates of the Old World. Our politicians determine how we should live our lives – and our individual liberties are sacrificed for the benefit of the Fatherland. – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140822072329/http:/www.harrybrowne.org/articles/AmericaWhatIs.htm"><em>Harry Browne</em></a></li>
 	<li>He who disdains the fall in infant mortality and the gradual disappearance of famines and plagues may cast the first stone upon the materialism of the economists. – <em>Ludwig von Mises</em></li>
 	<li>Freedom is the emancipation from the arbitrary rule of other men. – <em>Mortimer Adler (1902-2001)</em></li>
 	<li>Freedom suppressed and again regained bites with keener fangs than freedom never endangered. – <em>Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 B.C.)</em></li>
 	<li>The cry has been that when war is declared, all opposition should therefore be hushed. A sentiment more unworthy of a free country could hardly be propagated. If the doctrine be admitted, rulers have only to declare war and they are screened at once from scrutiny. – <em>William Ellery Channing (1780-1842), Life, 1848</em></li>
 	<li>A right is not what someone gives you; it's what no one can take from you. – <em>Ramsey Clark, U.S. Attorney General, New York Times, 10/02/77</em></li>
 	<li>The Bill of Rights is a born rebel. It reeks with sedition. In every clause it shakes its fist in the face of constituted authority … It is the one guarantee of human freedom to the American people. – <em>Frank I. Cobb (1869-1923), LaFollette's Magazine, 01/20</em></li>
 	<li>Men in authority will always think that criticism of their policies is dangerous. They will always equate their policies with patriotism, and find criticism subversive. – <em>Henry Steele Commager (1902-1998), Freedom and Order, 1966</em></li>
 	<li>Freedom is not a luxury that we can indulge in when at last we have security and prosperity and enlightenment; it is, rather, antecedent to all of these, for without it we can have neither security nor prosperity nor enlightenment. – <em>Henry Steele Commager (1902-1998), Freedom, Loyalty and Dissent, 1954</em></li>
 	<li>It will be found an unjust and unwise jealousy to deprive a man of his natural liberty upon a supposition that he may abuse it. – <em>Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658), Address, First Protectorate Parliament, 1654</em></li>
 	<li>Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the constitution by claiming it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard don't see the danger of the big picture. They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use this same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like. – <em>Alan Dershowitz, in The Conceptual Foundations of Anglo-American Jurisprudence in Religion and Reason, 82 Mich L. Rev., 204 (Dan Gifford), 1995</em></li>
 	<li>The privacy and dignity of our citizens [are] being whittled away by sometimes imperceptible steps. Taken individually, each step may be of little consequence. But when viewed as a whole, there begins to emerge a society quite unlike any we have seen – a society in which government may intrude into the secret regions of a [person's] life. – <em>William O. Douglas (1898-1980), U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Osborne v. United States</em></li>
 	<li>It is better, so the Fourth Amendment teaches us, that the guilty sometimes go free than the citizens be subject to easy arrest. – <em>William O. Douglas (1898-1980), Henry v. United States, 1959</em></li>
 	<li>Of all the tyrannies on human kind
the worst is that which persecutes the mind.
– <em>John Dryden (1631-1700), The Hind and the Panther, 1687</em></li>
 	<li>Abuse of power isn't limited to bad guys in other nations. It happens in our own country if we're not vigilant. – <em>Clint Eastwood, Parade Magazine, 1/12/97</em></li>
 	<li>Any time we deny any citizen the full exercise of his constitutional rights, we are weakening our own claim to them. – <em>Dwight David Eisenhower (1890-1969), U.S. President, Reader's Digest, 12/63</em></li>
 	<li>Here in America we are descended in spirit from revolutionaries and rebels – men and women who dare to dissent from accepted doctrine. – <em>Dwight D. Eisenhower (1890-1969), U.S. President, Speech, Columbia University, 1954</em></li>
 	<li>Man exists for his own sake and not to add a laborer to the State. – <em>Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882), Journal, 1839</em></li>
 	<li>He is free who lives as he wishes to live; who is neither subject to compulsion nor to hindrance, nor to force; whose movements to action are not impeded, whose desires attain their purpose, and who does not fall into that which he would avoid. – <em>Epictetus (ca 55-135 A.D.), Discourses, ca 100 A.D.</em></li>
 	<li>Complete and accurate surveillance as a means of control is probably a practical impossibility. What is much more likely is a loss of privacy and constant inconvenience as the wrong people gain access to information, as one wastes time convincing the inquisitors that one is in fact innocent, or as one struggles to untangle the errors of the errant machine. – <em>Victor Ferkiss, Technological Man: The Myth and the Reality, 1969</em></li>
 	<li>We are willing enough to praise freedom when it is safely tucked away in the past and cannot be a nuisance. In the present, amidst dangers whose outcome we cannot foresee, we get nervous about her, and admit censorship. – <em> M. Forster (1879-1970), Two Cheers for Democracy, 1951</em></li>
 	<li>"For your own good" is a persuasive argument that will eventually make a man agree to his own destruction. – <em>Janet Frame, Faces In The Water, 1982</em></li>
 	<li>Being tolerant does not mean that I share another one's belief. But it does mean that I acknowledge another one's right to believe, and obey, his own conscience. – <em>Victor Frankl (1905-1997), The Will To Meaning</em></li>
 	<li>The more laws the more offenders. – <em>Thomas Fuller (1608-1661), Gnomologia, 1732</em></li>
 	<li>The individual is the true reality of life. A cosmos in himself, he does not exist for the State, nor for that abstraction called "society" or the "nation," which is only a collection of individuals. – <em>Emma Goldman (1869-1940), The Place of the Individual in Society</em></li>
 	<li>There is no greater fallacy than the belief that aims and purposes are one thing, while methods and tactics are another … All human experience teaches that methods and means cannot be separated from the ultimate aim. – <em>Emma Goldman (1869-1940), My Disillusionment in Russia, 1923</em></li>
 	<li>The freedom of speech and the freedom of the press have not been granted to the people in order that they may say things which please, and which are based upon accepted thought, but the right to say the things which displease, the right to say the things which convey the new and yet unexpected thoughts, the right to say things, even though they do a wrong. – <em>Samuel Gompers (1850-1924), Seventy Years of Life and Labor, 1925</em></li>
 	<li>I know of no method to secure the repeal of bad or obnoxious laws so effective as their stringent execution. – <em>Ulysses S. Grant (1882-1885), U.S. President, Inaugural Address, 4 March 1869</em></li>
 	<li>Heresy is only another word for freedom of thought. – <em>Graham Greene (1904-1991)</em></li>
 	<li>The doctrine of blind obedience and unqualified submission to any human power, whether civil or ecclesiastical, is the doctrine of despotism, and ought to have no place among Republicans and Christians. – <em>Angelica Grimke (1805-1879), Anti-Slavery Examiner, September 1836</em></li>
 	<li>Books won't stay banned. They won't burn. Ideas won't go to jail. In the long run of history, the censor and the inquisitor have always lost. The only sure weapon against bad ideas is better ideas. The source of better ideas is wisdom. – <em> Whitney Griswold (1909-1963), New York Times, 24 February 1959</em></li>
 	<li>Whenever they burn books they will also, in the end, burn human beings. – <em>Heinrich Heine (1797-1856), Almansor: A Tragedy, 1823</em></li>
 	<li>To limit the press is to insult a nation; to prohibit reading of certain books is to declare the inhabitants to be either fools or knaves. – <em>Claude-Adrien Helvetius</em></li>
 	<li>What seems fair enough against a squalid huckster of bad liquor may take on a different face, if used by a government determined to suppress political opposition under the guise of sedition. – <em>Learned Hand (1872-1961), Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals, United States v. Kirschenblatt, 1926</em></li>
 	<li>I cannot assent to the view, if it be meant that the legislature may impair or abridge the rights of a free press and of free speech whenever it thinks that the public welfare requires that it be done. The public welfare cannot override constitutional privilege. – <em>John Marshall Harlan (1833-1911), U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Patterson v. Chicago</em></li>
 	<li>In view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our Constitution is colorblind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. – <em>John Marshall Harlan (1833-1911), U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896</em></li>
 	<li>The liberty of the individual is the greatest thing of all, it is on this and this alone that the true will of the people can develop. – <em>Alexander Ivanovich Herzen (1812-1870), From the Other Shore, 1849</em></li>
 	<li>A censor is a man who knows more than he thinks you ought to. – <em>Granville Hicks (1901-1982)</em></li>
 	<li>Where men cannot freely convey their thoughts to one another, no other liberty is secure. – <em>William E. Hocking (1873-1966), Freedom of the Press, 1947</em></li>
 	<li>There can be no freedom without freedom to fail. – <em>Eric Hoffer (1902-1983), The Ordeal of Change, 1964</em></li>
 	<li>If there is any principle of the constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought – not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate. – <em>Oliver Wendall Holmes, Jr. </em><em>(1841-1935), U.S. Supreme Court Justice, United States v. Schwimmer, 1929</em></li>
 	<li>Liberty is often a heavy burden on a man. It involves the necessity for perpetual choice which is the kind of labor men have always dreaded. – <em>Oliver Wendall Holmes, Sr. </em><em>(1809-1884), Elsie Venner, 1861</em></li>
 	<li>Truth, in its struggles for recognition, passes through four distinct stages. First, we say it is damnable, dangerous, disorderly, and will surely disrupt society. Second, we declare it is heretical, infidelic and contrary to the Bible. Third, we say it is really a matter of no importance either one way or the other. Fourth, we aver that we have always upheld it and believed it. – <em>Elbert Hubbard (1856-1915), Roycroft Dictionary and Book of Epigrams, 1923</em></li>
 	<li>Emergency does not increase granted power or remove or diminish the restrictions imposed upon power granted or reserved. The Constitution was adopted in a period of grave emergency. Its grants of power to the federal government and its limitations of the power of the States were determined in the light of emergency, and they are not altered by emergency. – <em>Charles Evans Hughes (1862-1948), Chief Justice, U.S. Supreme Court, Home Building &amp; Loan Assn v. Blairsdell, 1934</em></li>
 	<li>The liberty of the press is not confined to newspapers and periodicals. It necessarily embraces pamphlets and leaflets. These indeed have been historic weapons in the defense of liberty, as the pamphlets of Thomas Paine and others in our history abundantly attest. – <em>Charles Evans Hughes (1862-1948), U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Lovell v. City of Griffin, 1938</em></li>
 	<li>I believe the State exists for the development of individual lives, not individuals for the development of the state. – <em>Julian Huxley (1878-1975)</em></li>
 	<li>Free speech is meaningless unless it tolerates the speech that we hate. – <em>Henry J. Hyde, U.S. Congressman, Speech, 5/3/91</em></li>
 	<li>It is not the function of our Government to keep the citizen from falling into error; it is the function of the citizen to keep the government from falling into error. – <em>Robert H. Jackson (1892-1954), U.S. Supreme Court Justice, American Communications Assn v. Douds, 1950</em></li>
 	<li>The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy. One's right to life, liberty and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly may not be submitted to vote; they depend on no elections. – <em>Robert H. Jackson (1892-1954), U.S. Supreme Court Justice, West Virginia Board of Education vs. Barnette, 1943</em></li>
 	<li>It is error alone which needs the support of government. Truth can stand by itself. – <em>Thomas Jefferson (1743-1846), U.S. President, Notes on the State of Virginia, 1782</em></li>
 	<li>The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish it to be always kept alive. It will often be exercised when wrong but better so than not to be exercised at all. I like a little rebellion now and then. It is like a storm in the atmosphere. – <em>Thomas Jefferson (1743-1846), U.S. President, Letter to Abigail Adams, 22 February 1787</em></li>
 	<li>We are reluctant to admit that we owe our liberties to men of a type that today we hate and fear – unruly men, disturbers of the peace, men who resent and denounce what Whitman called "the insolence of elected persons" – in word, free men … – <em>Gerald W. Johnson (1890-1980), American Freedom and the Press, 1958</em></li>
 	<li>Every man should know that his conversations, his correspondence, and his personal life are private. – <em>Lyndon B. Johnson (1908-1973), Remarks, 3/10/67</em></li>
 	<li>A shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits all cases. – <em>Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961), Modern Man in Search of a Soul, 1933</em></li>
 	<li>The wave of the future is not the conquest of the world by a single dogmatic creed but the liberation of the diverse energies of free nations and free men. – <em>John F. Kennedy (1917-1963), U.S. President, Speech, University of California, 3/23/63</em></li>
 	<li>At the heart of western freedom and democracy is the belief that the individual man … is the touchstone of value, and all society, groups, the state, exist for his benefit. Therefore the enlargement of liberty for individual human beings must be the supreme goal and abiding practice of any western society. – <em>Robert F. Kennedy (1925-1968), U.S. Senator, Speech, University of Capetown, 6/6/66</em></li>
 	<li>Men fight for liberty and win it with hard knocks. Their children, brought up easy, let it slip away again, poor fools. And their grand-children are once more slaves. – <em> H. Lawrence (1885-1938), 1915</em></li>
 	<li>If by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right, it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution. – <em>Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865), First Inaugural Address, 4 March 1861</em></li>
 	<li>In a free society the state does not administer the affairs of men. It administers justice among men who conduct their own affairs. – <em>Walter Lippmann (1889-1974), An Inquiry into the Principles of the Good Society, 1937</em></li>
 	<li>To argue against any breach of liberty from the ill use that may be made of it, is to argue against liberty itself, since all is capable of being abused. – <em>Lord George Lyttleton (1709-1773)</em></li>
 	<li>What is freedom? Freedom is the right to choose; the right to create for yourself the alternative of choice. Without the responsibility and exercise of choice a man is not a man but a member, an instrument, a thing. – <em>Archibald Macleish (1882-1982), 12/04/37</em></li>
 	<li>If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a state has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read or what films he may watch. – <em>Thurgood Marshall (1908-1993), U.S. Supreme Court Justice, 1969</em></li>
 	<li>To change masters is not to be free. – <em>Jose Marti y Perez (1853-1895)</em></li>
 	<li>Tolerance is a better guarantee of freedom than brotherly love; for a man may love his brother so much that he feels himself thereby appointed his brother's keeper. – <em>Everett Dean Martin (1880-1941), Liberty, 1930</em></li>
 	<li>No man is great enough or wise enough for any of us to surrender our destiny to. The only way in which anyone can lead us is to restore our belief in our own guidance. – <em>Henry Miller (1891-1980), The Wisdom of the Heart, 1941</em></li>
 	<li>I see men ordinarily more eager to discover a reason for things than to find out whether things are so. – <em>Michel de Montaigne (1532-1592), Essays</em></li>
 	<li>There is no crueler tyranny that that which is perpetrated under the shield of law and in the name of justice. – <em>Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu (1689-1755), The Spirit of the Laws, 1748</em></li>
 	<li>You have not converted a man because you have silenced him. – <em>John Morley (1838-1923), Critical Miscellanies</em></li>
 	<li>In any free society, the conflict between social conformity and individual liberty is permanent, unresolvable, and necessary. – <em>Kathleen Norris</em></li>
 	<li>The number of laws is constantly growing in all countries and, owing to this, what is called crime is very often not a crime at all, for it contains no element of violence or harm. – <em> D. Ouspensky (1878-1947), A New Model of the Universe, 1931</em></li>
 	<li>A good end cannot sanctify evil means; nor must we ever do evil, that good may come of it. – <em>William Penn (1644-1718), Some Fruits of Solitude in Reflections and Maxims</em></li>
 	<li>No free people can lose their liberties while they are jealous of liberty. But the liberties of the freest people are in danger when they set up symbols of liberty as fetishes, worshipping the symbol instead of the principle it represents. – <em>Wendell Phillips (1811-1884), in Liberty and the Great Libertarians (C. Spradling)</em></li>
 	<li>A lawyer with a briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns. – <em>Mario Puzo, The Godfather</em></li>
 	<li>If the fires of freedom and civil liberties burn low in other lands, they must be made brighter in our own. If in other lands the press and books and literature of all kinds are censored, we must redouble our efforts here to keep them free. If in other lands the eternal truths of the past are threatened by intolerance, we must provide a safe place for their perception. – <em>Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945), U.S. President, Speech, 6/30/38</em></li>
 	<li>One evening, when I was yet in my nurse's arms, I wanted to touch the tea urn, which was boiling merrily … My nurse would have taken me away from the urn, but my mother said "Let him touch it." So I touched it – and that was my first lesson in the meaning of liberty. – <em>John Ruskin (1819-1900), The Story of Arachne, 1870</em></li>
 	<li>There is nothing new in the realization that the Constitution sometimes insulates the criminality of a few in order to protect the privacy of us all. – <em>Antonin Scalia, U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Arizona v. Hicks, 3/3/87</em></li>
 	<li>There is no "slippery slope" toward loss of liberty, only a long staircase where each step down must first be tolerated by the American people and their leaders. – <em>Alan K. Simpson, U.S. Senator, New York Times, 9/26/82</em></li>
 	<li>The liberty the citizen enjoys is to be measured not by governmental machinery he lives under, whether representative or other, but by the paucity of restraints it imposes upon him. – <em>Herbert Spencer (1820-1903), Social Statics, 1850</em></li>
 	<li>A man's liberties are none the less aggressed upon because those who coerce him do so in the belief that he will be benefited. – <em>Herbert Spencer (1820-1903), Social Statics, 1850</em></li>
 	<li>The right to defy an unconstitutional statute is basic in our scheme. Even when an ordinance requires a permit to make a speech, to deliver a sermon, to picket, to parade, or to assemble, it need not be honored when it's invalid on its face. – <em>Potter Stewart (1915-1985), U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Walker v. Birmingham, 1967</em></li>
 	<li>Laws are like cobwebs which may catch small flies, but let wasps and hornets break through. – <em>Jonathan Swift (1667-1745), Gullivers Travels, 1726</em></li>
 	<li>Men love liberty because it protects them from control and humiliation by others, thus affording them the possibility of dignity; they loathe liberty because it throws them back on their own abilities and resources, thus confronting them with the possibility of insignificance. – <em>Thomas Szasz, The Untamed Tongue, 1990</em></li>
 	<li>Constitutions are checks upon the hasty action of the majority.

 	<li>But when no risk is taken there is no freedom. It is thus that, in an industrial society, the plethora of laws made for our personal safety convert the land into a nursery, and policemen hired to protect us become selfserving busybodies. – <em>Alan Watts (1915-1973), Tao: The Watercourse Way, 1975</em></li>

 	<li>To preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt.

 	<li>The history of liberty is the history of limitations on the power of government, not the increase of it.

 	<li>Whenever there is some trouble in any area of the economy, the simplest solution to many people is "Let the government fix it." Yet … every time the government uses its money or its power to favor this group or that … the net result is such a web of supports, subsidies, interventions and controls that it is almost impossible for a nation to find its way back into a dynamic system of really free enterprise. – <em>Lawrence Fertig</em></li>
 	<li>More worrisome is the notion that our civil liberties are subject to cancellation in times of crisis. Our Constitution seeks to protect rights the Framers deemed inalienable. It faces its gravest tests in times of crisis. – <em>Clint Bolick Reason Magazine, 12/02</em></li>
 	<li>I personally call the type of government which can be removed without violence "democracy," and the other, "tyranny." – <em>Karl Popper</em></li>

 	<li>The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or despotism … – <em>S. Supreme Court Justice David Davis, Ex Parte Milligan (1866)</em></li>

You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift.
You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.
You cannot help small men by tearing down big men.
You cannot help the wage-earner by tearing down the wage-payer.
You cannot further the brotherhood of mankind by encouraging class hatred.
You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich.
You cannot establish sound security on borrowed money.
You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn.
You cannot build character and courage by taking away man's initiative.
You cannot help man permanently by doing for them what they could do and should do for themselves.

Thieves don't loath freedom and individuality.
Thieves don't undermine the Constitution.

 	<li>A personal note to the Founding Fathers: We're sorry. We blew it. You made it possible for us to live free and we blew it.

 	<li>What kind of a society isn't structured on greed? The problem of social organization is how to set up an arrangement under which greed will do the least harm. – <em>Milton Friedman</em></li>
 	<li>Self-interest is not myopic selfishness. It is whatever it is that interests the participants, whatever they value, whatever goals they pursue. The scientist seeking to advance the frontiers of his discipline, the missionary seeking to convert infidels to the true faith, the philanthropist seeking to bring comfort to the needy – all are pursuing their interests, as they see them, as they judge them by their own values. – <em>Milton Friedman</em></li>
 	<li>History suggests that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom. – <em>Milton Friedman</em></li>
 	<li>When a man spends his own money to buy something for himself, he is very careful about how much he spends and how he spends it. When a man spends his own money to buy something for someone else, he is still very careful about how much he spends, but somewhat less what he spends it on. When a man spends someone else's money to buy something for himself, he is very careful about what he buys, but doesn't care at all how much he spends.
